### About this blog

As you can see from the page footer, this site is built on [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), and all content is available under Creative Commons. 

I started this in 2005 or so with WordPress and am moving to Octopress as of Feb 1 2012.

### Other topics and sites

I've learned the wisdom of not mixing topic sites, so when the watch-and-timekeeping content grew in volume I created a new site and domain, [WatchOtaku.com](http://watchotaku.com). It's quite different in organization, with both dictionary-type material as well as blogging. 

### Disclaimer
This weblog and site are run from my home DSL connection and [Debian](http://www.debian.org/) box. It is in no way associated with my job, employers or anyone else, and any opinions expressed here are mine and mine only.
