![An older picture of me post-hike in Vancouver, CA](http://www.phfactor.net/pics/me.jpg "Your author")

Welcome to my blog. My name is Paul Hubbard, I'm a computer engineer in San Diego, CA. Fnord self-hosted on my trusty Debian box and DSL connection, because I wish to make very clear that all opinions and content here are **personal** and not related to my employer. 

Whew. You knew that already, but it still needed to be said.

More about me - [my About.me](http://about.me/phubbard) page has lots of links. Google profile, LinkedIn, etc, no point duplicating them here.

You can reach me via email at [pfh@phfactor.net](pfh@phfactor.net).
