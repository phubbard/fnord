The '[ham radio' category](http://fnord.phfactor.net/category/ham-radio/) here has been silent since I [got my license](http://fnord.phfactor.net/2008/04/03/ki6pkn/), due to the fact that I've nothing on it.

Yep. Never been on the air. Sad, eh?

Today I found [this MetaFilter thread](http://www.metafilter.com/100039/No-ham-radio-for-old-men), which is a rich source of interesting links, and also [links](http://wouxun.com/Two-Way-Radio/KG-UVD1P.htm) to a Chinese HF handset, the Wouxun KG-UVD1.[ **One hundred bucks**](http://www.409shop.com/409shop_product.php?id=103954)!

Hmm. For that kind of price I might have to get one. That's a lot less than the Yaesu, [Icom](http://www.eham.net/reviews/detail/5911) and Kenwood handsets I had looked at.

Because, of course, [ham radio is sexy](http://search.dilbert.com/search?p=R&srid=S3%2d6&lbc=dilbert&w=Ham%20Radio&url=http%3a%2f%2fdilbert%2ecom%2fstrips%2fcomic%2f1995%2d01%2d19%2f&rk=2&uid=195679452&sid=2&ts=custom&rsc=-AMB7CeCj7KS1LJF&method=and&isort=date&view=list&filter=type%3acomic):

**Update**: Actually, I'd want the [KG-UVD1P V V +S002](http://www.409shop.com/409shop_product.php?id=104294) - that covers the 1.25m and 2m bands, the most-used for my Technician-class license. $115, plus [$12 for the USB cable](http://www.409shop.com/409shop_product.php?id=103760).
