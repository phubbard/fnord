So, [as previously ranted](https://fnord.phfactor.net/2013/02/19/twitter-and-phubbard-mutual-fail/) Twitter has slowly closed off my access to [my phubbard account](http://twitter.com/phubbard)

Today I stuck a fork in it. Two-fold approach going forward, I created a new account [pfhubbard](http://twitter.com/pfhubbard)and re-followed my list, and have also started being more active [as phubbard on app.net](https://alpha.app.net/phubbard)

I got one more followup from Twitter support; suffice it to say that 'support' is not the first adjective that springs to mind. 

	We know it can be difficult when you lose access to an account, but we use these verification requirements to make sure we donâ€™t give out any user information to the wrong person.
	
I'm now looking for a similar crowd on app.net and will migrate there as much as is possible. Please consider doing so as well - [app.net now has a free tier](http://blog.app.net/2013/02/25/introducing-a-free-tier/) and [how much do you like ads anyway?](http://brooksreview.net/2013/02/smoke-up-ass/)
