FedEx arrived today, delivering two semi-expected packages. One contained a [Nike+ SportBand](http://www.watchreport.com/2008/05/the-nike-sportb.html) and a 1GB USB key with images and such... cool toys, courtesy of Nike PR. This is for me to review for [WatchReport](http://watchreport.com/), of course.

Second package arrived a few hours later... Nike had managed to find a pair of size 15 Nike shoes with the proper pocket for the accelerometer!

(I [covered the predecessor](http://fnord.phfactor.net/2007/08/29/nikeipodwordpressplugin/) Nike+ stuff a while back, see [this page](http://www.watchreport.com/2008/05/the-nike-sportb.html) also.)

So my watch habit got me a free gadget watch AND a free pair of shoes. Those who know my shameful secret quest for comfortable shoes will understand just how happy I am right now. Shallow? Why yes, I suppose I am...

I'm (cough) not much of a runner, haven't done it since track in high school, so we'll see. I will at least hit the UCSD track at noon to walk a bit and see how it all works. Hmm. This competes with [my Omron](http://code.google.com/p/omron-osx-driver/)...
