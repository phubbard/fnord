There's an art installation this week about land mines, so for the opening they did this to the grassy areas outside the building:

and

They did a nice job - maybe six different versions & languages, and even the yellow tape was apparently authentic. Can you _imagine_ the nightmarish negotiations this must've required with the campus safety people? Wow.

The installation is interesting, they put astroturf in the room and have video projectors running, I need to go spend enough time to see it all.
