We visited Chicago a few weeks ago, and had time to visit Diego's lab at [APS](http://aps.anl.gov/). His is the grown-up version of [where I used to work](http://fnord.phfactor.net/2006/09/25/my-old-lab-is-still-there/). APS is the real deal; makes me miss the lab environment. 

Anyway, Diego is doing some amazing stuff with x-ray optics. Check this out:

That's silicon, cut on the 110 crystallographic axis, painstakingly diced up into tiny cubes using a diamond saw and pressed into a parabolic lens carved out of a polymer base.

I shudder to think how much work this was. Those cubes are tiny; the optics shop really did an excellent job on these.

He's made them out of different substrates and materials, this one was discarded as part of the process. I now have a supercool desk ornament to admire. 

He's not yet published the work, I'll try and post a link when he does. The science is really innovative, and I say that as someone [published in the field](http://link.aip.org/link/?RSINAK/69/3504/1).

Science. It's awesome.
