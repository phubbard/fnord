I've been meaning to post about the Aeropress, but had forgotten until the last post about espresso. Briefly, it rocks. No significant negatives after several months of usage.Want more detail? [Check out Dan's review](http://www.dansdata.com/aeropress.htm) for images, critique, humor and lots and lots of detail. The picture is one I swiped from his review.

Cheap, effective, easy to clean, excellent coffee in single-user quantities. Excellent for camping, too.
