I've been working my way through a box of Luminox watches for WatchReport, and have also been enjoying what is probably the single coolest freebie I've gotten to date. It's a Luminox-branded flashlight:

But this one does tricks. First press lights up the white LEDs around the outside:

OK, that's nice, but see what happens on the next press:

It took me a while to figure this out; at first I thought it was just a slightly different color set. More efficient? Gimmick?

Then came the a-ha moment: It's [ultraviolet light](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet)! Perfect for seeing what dies flouresce, checking out the security printing on your license, and charging the lume on watches.

And it has yet One More Trick, too:

A nice, bright laser light. Good for hundreds of meters at night. How's that for an awesome flashlight?
