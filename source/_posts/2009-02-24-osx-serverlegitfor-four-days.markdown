As previously noted, I've been wanting to try OSX server to solve some calendar/addressbook questions. Yesterday, I got my eval copy from Apple, and here 'tis, ticking away happily in VMware, 64 bit no less:

Lovely! (It's downloading all the updates since it was shipped). Here's the problem, though - the serial number Apple gives you? It expires 2/29/09. As in, I have all of **four days** before it drops dead. Four work days at that, sigh. If I didn't have responsibilities I'd be tempted to stay up as long as possible and hack away. Few things are more enticing than an operating system long anticipated, and running it safely enclosed in a VM is even nicer.

Ahh well. Maybe this means that the next version, 10.6 aka 'Snow Leopard,' will ship soon and I can eval _that_.
