If you've not seen it yet, an astounding infographic in the latest IEEE Spectrum magazine that really manages to communicate the scales inherent in our energy consumption. Specifically, just what it'd take to replace our current oil usage.

I hadn't found it online, so the above came to me via [The Oil Drum](http://www.theoildrum.com/node/2186), another excellent site. Best place I've found to learn the science behind oil - exploration, drilling, reserves, alternatives, the works. Highly recommended.

"One cubic **mile** per year."

As Neo would say, whoa.
