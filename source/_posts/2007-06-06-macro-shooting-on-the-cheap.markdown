Via [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/software/diy/build-a-10-macro-photo-studio-186538.php), I built myself a [ten-dollar lightbox](http://strobist.blogspot.com/2006/07/how-to-diy-10-macro-photo-studio.html) for macro photography. Here's the first result, as [posted to SCWF:](http://www.network54.com/Forum/78440/thread/1181196571/Photo+practice...tools+and+tool+watches)

This is two Ikea halogens as a first try. I think a bit more work (lining the box with white fabric to increase light, adding more lights, white paper reflector [as shown in their example](http://strobist.blogspot.com/2006/08/on-assignment-shoot-your-shiny-new.html), maybe try it in daylight) will yield some decent results. I need to do shoots for [for watch reviews](http://www.watchreport.com/), and this is a cheap way to do it.

Recommended! 

Update 6/7/07: If you want to see the real deal, check out [SteveG's macro setup.](http://ninanet.net/watches/macroset/macroset.html) OMFG. He gets the results, too.
