![](http://www.phfactor.net/wp-pics/safari-logo-png.png)Via [Anarchia](http://anarchaia.org/archive/2008/03/23.html), an excellent [post of hidden abilities](http://dmiessler.com/blog/8-powerful-features-of-safari-that-few-people-know-about)Â inside Safari:

	
  1. Browsing and Search Snapback
	
  2. URL Path Navigation
	
  3. Web Inspector
	
  4. Activity Window
	
  5. Inline Dictionary
	
  6. Selection to Speech
	
  7. Quick Notes
	
  8. Email Page Link
The 'make sticky from text' and 'email link to page hotkey' are particularly compelling, and I suspect Chris'd like the CSS viewer.
