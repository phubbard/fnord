Here are two absolutely fantastic essays, well worth the time to sit and read and ponder. Days later, I'm still contemplating both in idle moments...



[Essay one](http://www.willwilkinson.net/flybottle/2009/08/28/the-menaissance-and-its-dickscontents/) and (related) [essay two.](http://www.psy.fsu.edu/~baumeistertice/goodaboutmen.htm)



A couple of quotes to pique your interest:


> 
 Since I was a teenager, I’ve found old-school machismo pathetic and somehow irrelevant to the problem of becoming a man. Without even knowing what or why it was, I was heavily influenced by gay culture, which provided me, and many other straight young men, a wide variety of templates for manhood that are at once unmistakably masculine, playfully ironic, aesthetic, emotionally open, and happily sexual. You can be manly and care about shoes!!! I’ll confess that I used to periodically regret my heterosexuality because there seemed to be greater scope for constructing a distinctive and satisfying male identity within gay culture. I think that’s telling. 




(from the first).

> 
Any man who reads the newspapers will encounter the phrase “even women and children” a couple times a month, usually about being killed. The literal meaning of this phrase is that men’s lives have less value than other people’s lives. The idea is usually “It’s bad if people are killed, but it’s especially bad if women and children are killed.” And I think most men know that in an emergency, if there are women and children present, he will be expected to lay down his life without argument or complaint so that the others can survive.




Lots and lots of thought-provoking ideas about gender, society, biology and evolution. Read them both, leave comments there or here.
