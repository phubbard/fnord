In the continuing list of food and bookmarks, I present to you the spectacle that is [Permian Shrimp.](http://www.usmsfp.org/farm-websites/texas%20news/seafoodwithoutthesea.htm)

Shrimp, without the ocean, raised in waters from the Permian Basin in Texas. An ancient sea is tapped to farm-raise shrimp, which according the article are organic (unpolluted water) and tasty.

Amazing times we live in. I'm also amused to see the oil prospectors bane used so cleverly.
