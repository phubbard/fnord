Yep, I got to go to [WWDC](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc) 2013, Apple's sold-out-in-70-seconds developer conference. A week of amazement!

It was a *great* trip, and I'm delighted to have gone. My first time, and I hope to go again, though given the glitches and superfast sellout, I'm by no means sure I'll be able to get a ticket again. This year, I tried to register but got an error on the Apple site, and was called back a day or two later; I'm not sure why I was chosen. 

Apple and secrecy; they go together like Smurfs and buckshot.

### My tips
* I flew Virgin America, my favorite carrier these days, morning flight on Monday from SAN to SFO. There was fog, so I missed the first 20 minutes of the keynote. Flights both ways were packed but otherwise fine.
* Hotel was the Pickwick, which is OK - nice and close, price reasonable and the lack of AC was no problem.
* Be sure you have your Ethernet adapter; the xcode and beta downloads are gigabytes and Apple has a wired network that's optimal.
* [SubEthaEdit](http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/) is AWESOME for note-taking. Having ten people doing the work lets you keep up and still end up with a very detailed set of notes. Met some nice people this way, too.
* I wish the session were not under NDA, as I'd love to write about them, but that's Apple's choice to make. Ahh well.

### Snaps

SFO:

WiFi was superbly run, fast and reliable.

I spent a few hours talking to the folks at [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com), which involved seeing some nice sights.

The after-hours party had good food, I left early as crowds are not my thing.

It was great. Go if you can. Not as intense/packed as PyCon, but a more sustainable pace. After PyCon, I was 'tech hangover' for a week; after WWDC I had no such effect. Longer sessions, longer breaks, better balance.
