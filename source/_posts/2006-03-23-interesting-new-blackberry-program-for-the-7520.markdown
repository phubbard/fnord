I got an unsolicited email from a vendor, to tell me about [their new program Naggie.](http://www.naggie.com/main.html) It uses the GPS on the blackberry to work with your to-do list, which sounds pretty cool.

Currently, the only BB with GPS is the 7520 from Nextel, so I can't test it.

Website says that its free but may not remain so.

I am tremendously curious to see how people use the location data in a mobile PDA, and this is one step. For example, if you're working construction, a to-do list that changes to match the job site would be pretty useful.
