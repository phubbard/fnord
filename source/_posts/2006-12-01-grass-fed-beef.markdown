Last year, I read [an amazing article on the Times](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E5DB153BF932A05750C0A9649C8B63&sec=health&pagewanted=all) by Michael Pollan called 'Power Steer', where he purchased a steer and followed it from birth to slaughter. Pollan is the author of 'The Omnivore's Dilemma' and other books, and writes quite well. In it, he spends a lot of time explaining just _why_ corn-fed beef is bad, both for us and the cows.

I was reminded of this today, when [Mark Morford wrote a nice article](http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/gate/archive/2006/12/01/notes120106.DTL&nl=fix) on grass-fed beef that links to [this Slate article](http://www.slate.com/id/2152674/) reviewing several sources. The winner is [Alderspring Ranch](http://www.alderspring.com/). At $21.50/lb (ouch!), they were the cheapest, too. (!!)

When we were in Illinois, it was reasonably easy to get [locally produced beef](http://www.heartlandmeats.com/) at the farmers' markets. Here in SoCal, it's not so easy. Given the rave reviews in the Slate article and Morford, I'm tempted to try the Alderspring but _damn_ that's a lot of money for a steak.

The continuing irony never ceases to amuse. It's expensive and difficult to eat healthily, and cheap & easy to eat junk food. The public health consequences of this are a lot less funny, though.
