Via [Uncertainly Principles blog](http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2006/10/jetset_nerds.php), a link to a Symmetry article on how to travel like a certain variety of scientist:

Symmetry magazine has an article on travel tips for physicists, from other physicists. There are two scary things about this:

1) The degree to which the picture that emerges from the different tips aligns with unflattering stereotypes of physicists. Some of the items are funny travel stories, but the tips are all about keeping your laptop running, and how to live out of a single back for two weeks, and how to avoid actually talking to anyone during your travels.

2) The fact that I think most of the advice is excellent. God, I'm a dork.
