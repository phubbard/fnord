News last night that [another school shooting has occurre](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/15/us/15cnd-shoot.html?_r=1&hp=&oref=slogin&pagewanted=all)d.  (Pictures [here](http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2008/02/14/us/0214-SHOOTING_index.html)). This one is really close to home in that Chris was a prof at NIU from 99 to 2005, and Cole Hall where the shootings occurred was where she often lectured.

Quite sobering.
