Via the guilty-pleasure site [AoM](http://artofmanliness.com/2008/10/16/how-to-pack-a-bag-when-traveling/), a [site of astoundingly well made and beautiful... leather luggage](http://www.saddlebackleather.com/). Really.

![Bee-yoo-ti-ful](http://www.phfactor.net/wp-pics/prague.jpg)

[329 for a messenger bag](http://www.SaddleBackLeather.com/store/scripts/prodView.asp?idproduct=46) (!!), but browse the site. They are _obsessed_ with luggage, and in a good way:


> Will your grandkids contest the will over your present leather briefcase?

If your last bag were empty and someone was trying to steal it, would you fight for it tooth and nail?

Ever been stopped by 5 strangers in the same day asking where you got your leather bag?

Have you ever placed your leather satchel so people could admire it?

Besides the soon forgotten cash, what will you leave behind that they’ll remember you by?


Great ad copy, that.

We just missed the chance to go to India due to illness, heavy sigh, so all I can do is admire from afar.
