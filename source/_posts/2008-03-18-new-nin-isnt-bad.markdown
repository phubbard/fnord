[![](http://www.phfactor.net/wp-pics/avatar6.jpg)](http://ghosts.nin.com/)I just (legally, thanks much) downloaded the first part of Ghosts 1-IV from [the NIN website](http://ghosts.nin.com/). High-quality free MP3s of the first disc, the rest is must-pay. I'm on my second listen now, first impressions are surprise and liking - it's very ambient and chill, much more so than anything previous. More background music, especially given the total lack of vocals.

I was initially a huge fan of NIN (Hi, Chase!) but soured on or about the third album. Who knows, maybe this'll get me listening again. Anyway, worth a download if you're curious. I _really_ like this idea of giving away a portion of the album, no DRM, very nice.
