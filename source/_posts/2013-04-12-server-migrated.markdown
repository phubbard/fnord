Yep, finally retired the Atom 330 box and moved everything over to the new server I got for my birthday a few months ago. It's lots faster and uses even less power - under 20W max versus 90W for the last one. Smaller, nearly silent, SSD (256 mSATA), Core i3 CPU, 16GB of memory, just a delightful little box.

And it's *tiny*, this is the [Intel NUC](http://www.amazon.com/Intel-Computing-Gigabit-i3-3217U-DC3217IYE/dp/B0093LINVK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1365829087&sr=8-1&keywords=intel+NUC) hardware. Recommended.

Anyway, think I've got most of the services and such migrated, ping me if there's things broken.
