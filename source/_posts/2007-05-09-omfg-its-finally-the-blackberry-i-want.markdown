Via I'm-not-sure-which-gadget-blog, the Blackberry 8300 aka 'Curve':


![](http://www.phfactor.net/wp-pics/curve-1.jpg)


A large improvement indeed over my trusty [7290.](http://www.phfactor.net/bb/blog.html) Thinner, faster, 2 megapixel camera, MP3 player, finally sized to fit _in_ a pocket instead of the geek holster.

I've been waiting for this, particularly the form factor plus camera. Nearly jumped on the [8100 'Pearl'](http://the.taoofmac.com/space/blog/2007-02-25). However, I'm glad I waited, because I really like a full QWERTY keyboard.

It's not out yet on T-mobile, and the [iPhone](http://www.apple.com/iphone/) is due this summer too, along with the a-bit-thick [Helio Ocean](http://www.helio.com/page?p=press_release_detail&contentid=1174770553372), so we'll see what I end up with. It'll be really cool to have email + camera + phone, that's for sure. Finally, I'll be able to [blog like Chuck.](http://www.dr-chuck.com/csev-blog/) 

One way or the other, just like [the song](http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/onewayoranother.html) says.
