I'm using [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/) these days for RSS, and it has an easy way to pseudo-blog via the 'Share' button. I've added [a plugin](http://nothingoutoftheordinary.com/2007/05/26/wordpress-google-reader-widget/) to display them on the sidebar, lemme know what you think... you can also [surf to my shared items here](http://www.google.com/reader/shared/13495916299509272308).
