If you spend much time at all hanging out on the forums on [TimeZone](http://www.timezone.com/), you quickly realize that many of the posters there have more disposable income than you or I have in toto. The most jaw-dropping example of this came up last week. A recurring motif there is to have a poster ask the members 'Which of these two should I choose?', and the forum software lets people vote for one watch or another.

However, this person took it to a new level. Here are the [two choices he offered](http://forums.timezone.com/index.php?t=msg&goto=3022992&rid=49174#msg_3022992):

Yes, that's a [Ulysse Nardin Freak](http://www.ulysse-nardin.com/e/collection.e/watchdetail.e.jsp?ID_Group=10001I&ID_Cat=100000), the "Freak 28'800 V/h Diamond Heart" version. Limited edition of 99 pieces, and it really does MSRP for about, erp, one hundred grand. Which appears to be what the person has stacked up there.

The list of questions is long: What sorta person _has_ 100k to spend on a watch?

More to the point, how the [censored] do they have 100k **IN CASH** on their desk?

In my best Keanu Reeves voice, I hafta say "Whoa."

Go [read the thread.](http://forums.timezone.com/index.php?t=msg&goto=3022992&rid=49174#msg_3022992) The members did a pretty good job responding to this one.
