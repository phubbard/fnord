I had a couple of things in mind for [the new toy](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2007/07/08/new-camera-brief-review-finepix-s6000fd/) when we got it:


* Try the [Aperture trial edition](http://www.apple.com/aperture/) and work with [RAW images.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAW_image_file)


* Experiment with [HDR imaging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range_imaging), preferably via exposure bracketing.



I'm still working on both. Right now, the [Apple device page](http://www.apple.com/aperture/raw/cameras.html) lists three Fuji cameras; the S6000fd is not one of them. It may be possible to pass camera files through the Fuji software and thence into Aperture; I don't know yet.

HDR is more interesting. To get images like this:

or this:

](http://www.hdrsoft.com/examples.html)

you take a series of images at different [F-stops](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-stop), and then use [software](http://www.hdrsoft.com/index.html) to combine them into a single image. (There's much more detail about the theory and such on [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range_imaging).) Best case is if your camera supports [exposure bracketing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_bracketing). In that case, the camera takes 3 or more images, with the main exposure bracketed by plus or minus 1 or more f-stops. According to [this page](http://www.hdrsoft.com/support/faq_photomatix.html#camera):



> To get good results, it is important that each one of the source photos are taken with a sufficiently different exposure in order to properly cover the dynamic range of the scene. Taking three photos separated by two EVs (i.e. two full-stops), or five photos separated by one EV, will be sufficient for most outdoors scenes.



([This page](http://www.hdr-photography.com/aeb.html) lists support for auto exposure (AEB) bracketing by camera.)

Anyway, the S6000fd _does_ have AEB, but only +- 1 f-stop. Seems to be minimal for HDR. So this camera is not ideal for it. Not that I've gotten it to work yet, need to try the tripod and fiddle a bit more. Then again, images like this seem like they're worth the effort:

You can find a ton of examples of HDR [on Flickr.](http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=HDR&w=all&s=int) 

So overall, no joy on Aperture (yet) and mostly research and fiddling on the HDR side. I posted this to spur interest and see if anyone else is doing similar things.
