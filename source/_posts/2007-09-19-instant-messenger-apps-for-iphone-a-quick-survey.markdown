  1. Via [AppTapp](http://iphone.nullriver.com/beta/),

	
    1. Apollo IM. Very flaky, AIM only, deleted. UPDATE: see below

	
    2. MobileChat. AIM-only, and flaky.




	
  2. Web-based. These run via Safari, but because of that I don't think they can notify you if they're in the background.

	
    1. [Meebo](http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/iphone/meebo-goes-iphone-compatible-with-the-best-fully-optimized-mobile-im-client-290029.php) - looks pretty good

	
    2. [BeeJive](http://www.beejive.com/) - looks very good

	
    3. [Mundu](http://mundu.com/im/iphone/) - looks pretty good, [here](http://www.iphoneatlas.com/2007/08/03/the-best-iphone-im-client-yet-debuts/) is a recommend.





Of course, there are the main sites like [http://webmessenger.yahoo.com/](http://webmessenger.yahoo.com/) and similar from other services. However, none of those are multi-protocol, which I really need to have.

I'm trying BeeJive now, I really have to sort out the pile of various IM logins I have these days!

If you go web-based, you can use [iPhoneApper](http://www.jonsthoughtsoneverything.com/iphone_apper/) to make a launcher that goes directly to a given URL. Neat trick.

**Page updates**



	
  * 9/21: Added Mundu review link.

	
  * 9/23: Apollo v1.0 is out, now does AIM/ICQ/MSN. However, it also seems to burn battery.

	
  * 9/28/07: Amazingly, the 1.1.1 firmware _didn't_ include an IM program, which surprised me. Anyway, currently using Apollo, which for all its faults can at least ping me when its in the background.

	
  * 10/12/07: MobileChat is now multi-protocol, but seems to only allow one login at a time. I still get errors on my dot-mac account, but AIM and gtalk and MSN work for me.
