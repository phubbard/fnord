An absolutely fascinating [article on the physics of the longbow](http://www.stortford-archers.org.uk/medieval.htm), with focus on the battle of Agincourt in 1415. Did you know that the pull on these bows ranged from 110 to 180 **pounds?** Or that the 6000 English archers were able to drop 800 arrows per _second_ onto the French?

Yowza.

There's also a [second article in New Scientist](http://media.newscientist.com/article/mg13818763.800-the-longbows-deadly-secrets-english-success-at-the-battleof-agincourt-can-largely-be-put-down-to-strips-of-yew-wood-strung-withlinen-what-made-this-weapon-so-lethal.html), with a slightly different focus. Both are fascinating.

As an aside, did you know that the Pope banned crossbows in 1139?


> By 1300, the crossbow had largely displaced the longbow on European battlefields, despite being banned in 1139 by the Pope as 'deathly and hateful to God and unfit to be used by Christians'.


I don't seem to recall any recent similar prohibitions against, say, [MOABs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_of_all_bombs).
