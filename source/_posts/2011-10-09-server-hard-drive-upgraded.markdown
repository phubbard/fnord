If you can read this, all went well. Swapped the 2008-vintage 250GB system drive (itself surplus from my old MacBook 13) for a new 750GB drive. Still non-SSD, but for $90 we should have a few more years of storage and usage. 

Also swapped out the dead 40mm Zotac fan for a can't-close-the-case 80mm; a temporary measure that will likely sit as-is for several months.

I'm still pretty happy with the Zotac Ion system board, it's been rock solid and more than fast enough for this server to handle its load. Quiet, cool, and fully paid for. ;)
