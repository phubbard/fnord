I have to admit, the fact that [DopeWars is out for blackberry](http://www.bbhub.com/2006/01/24/dont-try-this-in-real-life-but-you-can-on-your-blackberry/) becomes even more appropriate when remember the Crackberry nickname.

I spent a _lot_ of time playing this on Palm, so it's like having an old friend back. An old, abusive, creepy yet compelling friend.

Free, and highly recommended.
