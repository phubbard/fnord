Yep, [IPv6 launch day](http://www.worldipv6launch.org/) is June 6 2012, and this year
it's going to remain on; this is the Big Red Switch Day.

I'm partially there, unlike [benc](http://benctechnicalblog.blogspot.com/) I'm not really setup yet. Need more
hacking time!

But do take a look [at the site](http://www.worldipv6launch.org/) and get your networks configured. There's a lot
to learn but the demise of IPv4 seems certain. Though, like all useful legacy technology (Cobol, anyone) it'll be around
for years in all of those "internet-enabled" embedded systems we've made.

Interesting times.
