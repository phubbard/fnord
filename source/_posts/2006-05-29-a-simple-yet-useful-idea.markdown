Recently, we switched from Quicken to [the slightly-oddly-named Moneydance.](http://moneydance.com/) Works well, deals well with QIF files, cross-platform, reasonable price, scripting interface, lots to like. Chris and I both work on the bills, and I had the clever idea of using Subversion to hold the data.

So now, the data lives on my server, in svn+ssh access. This gives us both access, allows reversions if something bad happens, and generally makes the whole process pretty darn easy. The access is only via SSH, with key required, so it's pretty secure. 

I thought it clever enough to share. Think for a second - what else could use this? Photo library? Hmm.
