  1. The AMS posts [the best explanation](http://www.ams.org/featurecolumn/archive/image-compression.html) I've yet seen of how JPEG works and even explains JPEG2000. Cool.

	
  2. The [iPhone has been unlocked!](http://machinist.salon.com/blog/2007/09/12/iphone_unlocked/index.html) It may well [get blocked by the next update](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/september#wed-12-free_unlock), but I'm still compelled. There are some [deliberate limitations on the iPod touch](http://the.taoofmac.com/space/blog/2007/09/09/0940) that bug me, and an unlocked iPhone is the same price... Hmm.

	
  3. Feeling excessively cheerful? Read [this on Salon](http://www.salon.com/ent/tv/feature/2007/09/12/gender_tv/print.html) about male roles on the small screen:


>  Yup. Welcome to the new world on television, where the women are strong, and the men are cavemen. Literally. ABC's "Cavemen," based on the Geico ad campaign character, is about a trio of Cro-Magnons with low self-esteem and a little hair-growth problem. Small-screen heroes who aren't actually dragging their knuckles behave even worse. In the face of professional and sexual equality between the televised sexes, these fictional guys are cowed, angry and generally emasculated by the successes of their female counterparts.





  4. Give your cheap Canon camera [high-end features like RAW and histograms.](http://www.linux.com/feature/118946) Free open-source firmware that adds all sorts of cool stuff, which you could then use to [play with HDR or similar.](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2007/07/09/aperture-hdr-and-more-about-the-new-camera/) And I chose Fuji; rats.
