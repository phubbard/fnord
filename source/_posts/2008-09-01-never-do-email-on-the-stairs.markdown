All puffed up, quite impressive:

Thankfully the bruising has faded, its been about 2 weeks. First time I've really rolled an ankle; usually if you let yourself fall into it you can avoid injury, but in this case I'd have fallen down a stairwell.Â 

Backstory: Late for a meeting, rushing down stairs, checking email on iPhone to see if a change had been sent out and missed that there was one more stair left. Oops.
