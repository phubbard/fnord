If you've not already discovered him, [Dan Neil of the LA Times](http://www.latimes.com/classified/automotive/highway1/) is a Pultizer-winning columnist who writes, unexpectedly, auto reviews. Really, really good ones. Check out these tidbits from [his latest column](http://www.latimes.com/classified/automotive/highway1/la-fi-neil17-2009apr17,0,6173168.column?track=rss):

Despite some published reports, the 2010 Camaro SS is not really what you'd call a sports car, unless you tend to shave with a chain saw or sign your name with a piece of burning timber or make scrambled eggs by dropping a piano on a chicken. The consonant quality of this car, from the moment you turn the key to the moment you gratefully leave it in the chiropractor's parking lot, is a wanton and cheerful disregard for finesse and delicacy.

This is exactly right.


Or, from [an R8 review](http://www.latimes.com/classified/automotive/highway1/la-hy-neil25jul25,0,4391243.story):
