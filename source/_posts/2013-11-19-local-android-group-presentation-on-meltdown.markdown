I've been a slacker on posting here, a quick update on [Meltdown](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.phfactor.meltdown). I've been coding on the next version, and have a working ContentProvider data store with Fragments UI in development. Should be faster, use less memory and start up much faster!

I volunteeered to talk about Meltdown to our local Android group, and it came out pretty well. [Slides, links and details are here](https://www.phfactor.net/at) for your perusal and amusement.
