Yep, [as previously noted](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2006/09/12/almost-here/), it took a bit of effort for [my Aviator](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2006/09/02/aviator-eta-2824-2-elabore-grade-as-cased-by-christopher-ward/) to fall into my sweaty palms, but I managed. Amazingly, someone actually _read_ my blog and wanted to know what _I_ thought of it.

Will wonders never cease.

I'm in the first phase, infatuation, so consider accordingly.

I found a [nice set of close-ups](http://christopherward.nl.eu.org/viewtopic.php?p=780#780) on [the unofficial Christopher Ward site](http://christopherward.nl.eu.org/), that's where the above picture is from. I currently don't have a camera with macro capability, so I'm gonna [borrow like the famous quote says](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Artist). (I always thought that was Picasso, but the page says Michael Berens.)

Some quick notes: It's only been a few days, so it may just be the postal abuse, but mine is running ~20s/day fast. I've exchanged email with Chris, and he suggested I adjust it myself; all you have to do is open the back and turn the screw on the Etachron. I'll give it a week or two and see if it still needs doing. Been meaning to learn more, anyway, so as long as I don't screw it up it should be interesting.

It's as pretty in person as the pictures suggest. Very legible, very classy. I'd call it more of a aviator-styled dress watch than an aviator, but that's just me. It's a bit smaller than the [behemoths I've been wearing of late](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2006/07/16/yes-i-need-help/), but at 38mm by 10.8mm its a nice size and shape. 

The luminosity at night is a mixed bag. The superluminova used is first-rate, but there's a lot less f it than the lighthouse-inspired Seiko divers that I'm used to. Readable all night, which is my primary figure of merit.

The movement is 28,800 vph, or 8 movements per second. The Seiko 7S26 I'm used to is 21,600 or 6Hz, so the movement is smoother and prettier. Same as the Rolex, at least modern ones like the 3130 and 3150.

The band is very dressy, and the deployant clasp works well. I will find something that I can get wet, and save this one for dressing up. 

Overall value is amazing. I _still_ can't find anything even close, even Seiko. Highly recommended.
