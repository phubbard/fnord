...was the show we went to on Friday. 

I'm an indifferent fan of Primus, but the show was good and the music interesting, with a very high skill level on the musicians and _killer_ LED-based light effects.

Sound boards are all digital now, of course, and I had a lot of fun watching the screens and trying to see what was going on.

The opening band, [Gogol Bordello](http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:hrkmiklabb39~T1), was awesome. Here's a pic, stolen from Allmusic:

**Very** high energy show, odd lyrics, odd side performers, very catchy. The front man gives even Southern Culture on the Skids a run for most entertaining and hyper. Think I'll need to get a CD or two and see how they are in the studio. It's not music you'd think'd be good, but I really liked their show.

If I do any more shows, though, I'm gonna get me some
