A [good article](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/14/fashion/sundaystyles/14allergies.html?pagewanted=all) in the NY Times led me to find the [American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Pollen Count site](http://www.aaaai.org/nab/index.cfm?p=pollen). They even have a counting station relatively close. No cost, no ads, much better than the commercial ones I've found to date.
