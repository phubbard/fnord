Every now and then I run across someone declaiming how Mozart is the best composer ever, blah blah blah. I was thinking unrelated thoughts the other day, and I had a mini-revelation:


Mozart and light-roast coffee have the same weakness: A total lack of intensity.


Consider: With notable exceptions like the Requiem, most of Mozart is [background (chamber) music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_music). It's light, cheerful, complex, cerebral and lacking in dynamic range. As devoid of emotion as possible, since chamber music is supposed to provide the audio backdrop for upper-class socialization. It doesn't engage, it doesn't _compel_.

Light roasted coffees are the same way. You'll see descriptions like 'floral', 'hints of X and Y,' 'subtle notes of Z' and so on. Blah blah blah. Real coffee looks like **this**:

That's a sublime French roast from Norm Whiting. (More on him in a bit.) It's complex, intense, multi-layered and _very_ tasty. Unlike a lot of places, Norm has an excellent mix of first-rate beans in his roast; many roasters just take cheap beans and cook 'em dark. Beware such crap!

Unless we've already met, you have likely never heard of Whiting Coffee. They don't advertise, don't have a website, and do **post**-paid mail order! (You pay **after** you get the coffee -- unheard of, eh?)

The other amazing thing about Norm is the value compared to other roasters. If I go elsewhere, I usually have to pay about $30/lb to match or exceed his roast. Shipped to my door, his is $8.

Yep, $8. So any excuses about cost are gone. Call the man at (505) 344-9144, tell him I sent you if you like. And for the love of god buy beans and grind them yourself!

Getting back to musical comparisons, I'll cut this short due to Anna bedtime - if complexity is why you like Mozart, try any or all of the following by [my man JSB](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2007/05/05/bach-anchovies-and-mozart/):



	
  1. [The Brandenburg Concertos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_concertos)

	
  2. [Art of Fugue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_of_fugue)

	
  3. [Musical Offering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_Offering)

	
  4. [The works for organ](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000E6UL6I), especially canons and fugues. (The [F minor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_minor) fugue is a revelation - the [Bowyer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Bowyer) performance is quite good.)

	
  5. [Goldberg variations ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldberg_variations). I like the [Feltsman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Feltsman) performance of these.

	
  6. And, of course, [the coffee cantata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_Cantata).


Ol' JSB did it all. Best enjoyed with a cuppa from Norm.
