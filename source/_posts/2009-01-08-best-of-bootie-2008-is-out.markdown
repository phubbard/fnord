I'm a big fan of mashups, and the Best of Bootie series are an excellent way to discover both mashups and new music. [Mashuptown](http://www.mashuptown.com/), [A+D](http://www.aplusd.net/) and others regularly have new tracks (there are even [podcasts](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&client=safari&rls=en-us&q=mashup+podcast&btnG=Search)), but the Best-of series ties it all up with a bow - album art, selected tracks, all in [one free zipfile](http://www.bootieusa.com/bestofbootie2008/Best%20of%20Bootie%202008.zip).Â 

20 tracks this year, playing as we speak!
