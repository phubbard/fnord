Via [Preshrunk](http://preshrunk.info/2007/06/sweet-sweet-coffee.php), a shirt that's probably got my number. Especially with the persistent [sleep deprivation.](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/category/anna/) I actually tried the new Starbucks yesterday, which I normally avoid.

Sigh. Meandering, aren't I? Anna's asleep next to me on the couch, Chris is crashed and Grandma M is likewise napping. I have **got** to get my sleep schedule more in phase or I am doomed.
