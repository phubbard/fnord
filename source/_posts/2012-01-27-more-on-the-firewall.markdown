  1. Just added the Magic Anti-Spam Firewall rule: Block inbound email if it comes from a Windows box. I have high hopes for this one...


  2. OSX VPN working


  3. Still working on VPN setup for iPhone and iPad based on [this tutorial.](http://doc.pfsense.org/index.php/Mobile_IPsec_on_2.0)


  4. Added packet shaping for BitTorrent and it made an enormous difference. You can't even tell a transfer is happening now! Perfect.



It's great. I continue to wish I'd gotten it sooner.
