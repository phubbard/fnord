I'm slowly coming to the realization that Octopress is an iffy fit to how I like to blog. The initial effort it requires to run rake and such seems to deter the quick posting. I do quite like the static site, though, and plan to keep that, so I am trying to figure out how to get the best writing setup. Might setup the [Neutron IDE](http://neutronide.com) and some scripting; that'd let me use my phone or tablet to blog.

Of course, since I rolled out Octopress there's been tons of new blogging platforms that might have worked better. Feel stupid? Why yes, I sure do.

Anyway, this morning I added the [Villainy theme](https://github.com/drunkdev/villainy-octopress-theme) just to change the look a bit. What do you think?
