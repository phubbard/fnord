(With apologies to[ John Bunyan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilgrim's_Progress))

The other day at work we bought a new printer for our group, an [Okidata C3400](http://www.c3400.co.uk/). Color, laser, 10/100 networked, drivers for OSX and Windows, under $400. 16 pages per minute in color, and a nice simple paper path that's supposed to reduce jams. Reasonable in appearance, too:

Note the lack of an LCD display - you get the status info from the drivers:

I was struck by how cheap'n'cheerful color network lasers have gotten, and also how OSX is now a first-class citizen as far as working drivers. Very nice!
