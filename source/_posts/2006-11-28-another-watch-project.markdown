If only I had my own CNC, I too could find a WW2-vintage Hamilton pocketwatch and recase it as a wristwatch.

Milling the case out of solid stainless:

and the finished product:

The [article is all in French](http://f24.parsimony.net/forum57818/messages/224595.htm) but worth going for the dozens of pictures.

Others have done similar watches. Here's a 922 cased by [RGM:](http://www.rgmwatches.com/index.html)

Hamilton was, until quartz, _the_ premier American watch company, producing really nice work. Ahh well.

Both of these are out of my price range, though I'm intrigued to see that RGM now produces pieces based on the Valjoux 7750, 7751 and ETA 2892, which means you can get an RGM for less than 2k. Not _much_ less, mind you, but less.

Hmm.
