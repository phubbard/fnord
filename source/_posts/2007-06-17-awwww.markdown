Quick notes so far:




  1. Sleep dep feels _just_ like jetlag, the really vicious kind from a 12+ flight with bad ergonomics and no sleep. My memory is _shot_.

  2. The joys are there!



  3. Be Prepared. It really helps. Wait, that's fatuous, isn't it? Sorry. I'll do better later.



As another blogger put it, the amount of happiness may have decreased, but there's a lot more joy in the house.

PS Oh yeah, we got a [new camera](http://www.amazon.com/Fujifilm-Finepix-Digital-Wide-Angle-Stabilization/dp/B000GFWFY8/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-9267325-0147933?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1182142271&sr=8-1) and [fast chip](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M73ERC/002-8622545-7884847) for kid pics. Still to arrive are the [UV filter and polarizer.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MDZGJK/104-9267325-0147933) We live in amazing times! This stuff was megabucks back when I first learned photography. Now a DSLR-lite is under $350!
