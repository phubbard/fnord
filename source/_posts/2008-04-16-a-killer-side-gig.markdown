![Yes Inca watch](http://www.phfactor.net/wp-pics/N202.4.jpg)I've been working on this for a while, but haven't mentioned it yet. I've got a sorta-informal consultation gig working with Bjorn Kartomten of [Yes Watches](http://www.yeswatch.com/).

Yes, this is _right_ up my alley and an absolute delight. I now wish there were more hours in the day!

Anyway, expect a review soon-ish of the current gen Yes (pictured) which Bjorn kindly gave to me. Ahh, a free watch, source of great happiness...

A watch has space and power constraints that are a most interesting challenge. Fun stuff. I met Bjorn when I was having dinner with long-time collaborator Christian Cantrell of [WatchReport](http://www.watchreport.com/), turns out that Yes is in La Jolla. Small world, eh?

Update 6/20/08: My review of the Inca[ is posted here](http://fnord.phfactor.net/2008/04/22/a-review-of-the-yes-inca-wristwatch/). Enjoy!
