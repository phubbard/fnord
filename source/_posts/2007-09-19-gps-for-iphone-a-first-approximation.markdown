Via [Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/apple/iphone-gps-hack-works-301459.php), news of the [Navizon](http://navizon.com/) application that locates your approximate location using cell towers, ESSIDs from Wi-Fi and user-contributed coordinates.

This is a workaround for the fact that the iPhone has no GPS or cell-tower localization, which reduces the usefulness of the Google Maps application. Navizon integrates with Maps, and is usually close enough to be useful. I've managed a fix or two and am super pleased to have it available. Nice!

**Update 10/12/07:** It's commercial code. My copy just expired. I'm a little pissed that I had no warning it was demise-ware, this is very weak of them. Deleted.
