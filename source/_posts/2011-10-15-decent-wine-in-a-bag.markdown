One of the minuses of small children is alcohol - Chris is off of it for a while, so if I want wine with dinner I end up wasting most of the bottle. I've had my eye open for good wine in a bag; those keep better once opened as the air never goes into the bag, and there's less material to recycle or landfill.

I found this at the local market:

'The Climber' brand. $15 for 1.5l, or two normal bottles' worth. Alas, the wine was harsh, and as shown the valve leaked constantly. Anyone know of a brand and type they can actually recommend? I like the idea, surely someone has done a better job of this.
