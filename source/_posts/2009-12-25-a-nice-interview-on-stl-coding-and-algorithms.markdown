[Alexander Stepanov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Stepanov) is the main driver behind the OMFG-that's-amazing[ Standard Template Library](http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/) for C++. I rather agree with him [on object oriented programming](http://www.antiquark.com/escape/public_html/stepanovusa.html) (OOP):


> I find OOP technically unsound. It attempts to decompose the world in terms of interfaces that vary on a single type. To deal with the real problems you need multisorted algebras - families of interfaces that span multiple types. I find OOP philosophically unsound. It claims that everything is an object. Even if it is true it is not very interesting - saying that everything is an object is saying nothing at all. I find OOP methodologically wrong. It starts with classes. It is as if mathematicians would start with axioms. You do not start with axioms - you start with proofs. Only when you have found a bunch of related proofs, can you come up with axioms. You end with axioms. The same thing is true in programming: you have to start with interesting algorithms. Only when you understand them well, can you come up with an interface that will let them work.


The [rest of the interview](http://www.antiquark.com/escape/public_html/stepanovusa.html) is quite good as well.
