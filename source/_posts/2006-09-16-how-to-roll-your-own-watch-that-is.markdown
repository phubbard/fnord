A [very nice set of pages](http://web.ticino.com/dcorson/watch/index.html) about making your own watch, from Donald Corson. He took the guts of an ETA 2824, and went somewhere totally new with it. Machined base plate, rearranged the drive train, experimented with new plating, designed his own hands, and learned a great deal on the way. Fascinating, wish I had his resources to experiment with.
