Years ago, one of my favorite quotations was from "The Book of Merlin," by TH White. (Google now has the [entire book online here](http://books.google.com/books?id=t1_hnB01TKkC).) I'm lazy, so this is abridged from a large paragraph:


> We find that at present the human race is divided poltically into one wise man, nine knaves and ninety fools out of every hundred. . . the ninety fools plod off behind the banners of the nine villains, according to fancy, into the labyrinths of chicanery, malice and warfare.


Which brings me to another book. I'm not sure where I found the link, but I've been reading a book called '[The Authoritarians](http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~altemey/)' by academic Bob Altemeyer. It's a free download in PDF format and represents an entire careers' worth of research on authoritarians. Outlook, motivation, transmission of ideas, and a great deal more. He does a nice job of balancing opinion with solid data and surveys, so no matter your leanings its a fascinating and worthwhile read.

For example, I've been puzzled why candidate A keeps repeating statements provably false. Altemayer's work explains that the target subgroup wants to believe and has no problems accepting conflicting statements from authority. So, basically, the Big Lie works due to mental shortcomings of the target audience.

[Read it.](http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~altemey/) Along with, perhaps, [Cialdini's "Persuasion.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cialdini)" Then join me in fearing for the future of our country.
