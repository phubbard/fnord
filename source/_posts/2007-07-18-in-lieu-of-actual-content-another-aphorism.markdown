From [JR](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2007/06/17/this-man-is-one-of-my-heros/), of course:



> 
127.
To me the great divide is between the talk-
ative and the quiet. Do they just say every-
thing that's on their minds, even _before_ it's on
their minds? Sometimes I think I could just
turn up my head like a Walkman so what's
going on there could be heard by others. But
there would still be a difference. For inside
the head they are talking to people like them,
and I am talking to someone like me: he is 
quiet and doesn't much like being talked at; he
can't conceal how easily he gets bored.
