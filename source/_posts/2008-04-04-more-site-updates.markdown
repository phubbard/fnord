  1. WordPress version updated to 2.5, quite a bit nice from the admin side but there should be few if any changes visible on fnord and annalog.

	
  2. I'm having a lot of fun posting to [the Asaph microblog](http://asaph.phfactor.net/), so please check that out now and then and let me know what you think. It's really easy and fast to microblog, so I can post a lot more stuff there.
