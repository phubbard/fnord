Oops. Turns out that mod_rewrite isn't enabled in Debian's Apache2. Or in the mods-available directory. But it _is_ there to be used. Confusing, eh?

Anyway, everything except the front page of the blog was down because of this. I'll test some more, but we seem to be back up. Sorry, Terri!

Props to [this explanation](http://lavluda.com/2007/07/15/how-to-enable-mod_rewrite-in-apache22-debian/) of how to fix it.
