![Hmm](http://www.phfactor.net/wp-pics/p-n-l.png)


Doing the checkbook thing, and trying to figure out if we can manage to replace the 18-year-old-and-cranky [pickup](http://fnord.phfactor.net/2007/09/09/our-truck-gets-stolen/), so I'm crunching finances in [Moneydance](http://fnord.phfactor.net/2006/05/29/a-simple-yet-useful-idea/). This (carefully dimensionless, thanks) graph is from the past year or so. Better than [average](http://fnord.phfactor.net/2008/02/27/one-possible-fate-of-the-housing-bubble-expansion/), I suppose, but still not looking like we can retire soon or buy a [Phaeton](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/highway1/la-hy-neil26apr26,1,2545835.story?coll=la-news-highway_1). ;)

After a couple of years, we're pretty happy with Moneydance. Works well, no crashes, and with subversion we can work on either computer easily. Recommended.
