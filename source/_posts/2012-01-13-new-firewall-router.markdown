My [Netgate 2D3](http://store.netgate.com/Netgate-m1n1wall-2D3-2D13-Red-P218C83.aspx) arrived and is installed - more on this later, it's a nano-BSD box, no moving parts, 2-3W power and full pf onboard with awesome web GUI, hardware (HiFN) crypto accelerator, and tons of capacity to do filtering, packet scrubbing and much much more.

I am in heaven. Highly recommended.
