Several years ago I bought a license for the [Mint analytics software](http://haveamint.com/). 
It's self-hosted, no data sharing (which is my main qualm with Disqus) and you can see the output
[here any time you want](http://www.phfactor.net/mint/).

I just added it to Octopress, so the data will be worthless for a while.
