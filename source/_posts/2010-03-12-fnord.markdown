That, my friends, is a '[QR code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_Code)' generated by [this site](http://qrcode.kaywa.com/). All this one encodes is the URL 'fnord.phfactor.net'. You can also make one with text, phone number or SMS (text message.)

On the iPhone, I'm using t[he QuickMark app](http://www.quickmark.com.tw/En/info/Show.asp) to decode 'em, which seems to work pretty well and also does old-school barcodes.

Pointless? [Check this usage out](http://www.engadget.com/2007/10/08/the-pet-shop-boys-embed-qr-codes-in-latest-orwellian-video/), and be sure and watch the linked video.

There are [some other uses](http://mashable.com/2009/01/07/qr-codes/) as well. You've got roughly 7KB of data, depending on encoding and error correction. Amazing times we live in, eh?
