OK children, compare the following. From [my posting:](http://www.watchreport.com/2007/03/the_new_seiko_p.html)



> 
For many years now, Seiko has sold a line of mechanical dive watches based on the trusty 7S26 movement (the heart of the watch). They retail for under $200, they are well made and reliable, and they are generally considered to be excellent "beaters".

The problem is that the 7S26 movement is burdened with a couple of design compromises: you can't wind it by hand, and it is a non-hacking movement, which means that when you pull the stem out all the way, the movement doesn't stop as you might expect (making it very difficult to set the watch with much accuracy). Of course, Seiko sells several other watches with better movements, but they cost more.

As of April 2007, that's about to change. Seiko is introducing three new divers based on the 6R15 movement which is more accurate, can be wound by hand, and can be hacked. With stainless steel cases, they come in black (SBDC001), blue (SBDC003), and orange (SBDC005), and will be priced at $428 (63,000 yen). If you want to get an early start, all three watches can be pre-ordered from Seiya.




and now from [this page:](http://www.wriststyle.com/entry/new-seiko-prospex-6r15-divers/)

With stainless steel cases these new divers comes in three colors i.e. black (SBDC001), blue (SBDC003) and you’ll surely love orange (SBDC005).

These watches are bit costly, it will cost you $428 (63, 000yen). And it’s a nice BIG one too, at 45mm without the crown. 




And then credit Seiya as a source. Ahh well, I guess it's flattery, eh? They did reorder the words a fair bit.

Oh yeah, the title of this posting refers to [the previous note.](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2007/03/14/fame-fortune-seiko/)
