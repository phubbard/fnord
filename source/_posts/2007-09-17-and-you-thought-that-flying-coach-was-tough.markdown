> A female shorebird was recently found to have flown 7,145 miles (11,500
kilometers) nonstop from Alaska to New Zealand - without taking a break for

according to biologists who tracked the flight using satellite tags.

The bird, a wader called a bar-tailed godwit, completed the journey in nine
days. In addition to demonstrating the bird's surprising endurance, the
trek confirms that godwits make the southbound trip of their annual
migration directly across the vast Pacific rather than along the East Asian
coast, scientists said.


**Nine days of non-stop flight.** Longest ever measured.
