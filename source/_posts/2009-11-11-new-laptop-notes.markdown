So I got a new laptop at work, and based on [some good data ](http://www.anandtech.com/printarticle.aspx?i=3631)I wrangled the solid state drive instead of a conventional hard drive. I had to go on a file jihad to make space (down to 250GB, ug) but the results are _astounding_:

Y'know, for a laptop that's nothing short of astonishing! Easily 3x the old drive. The read is even faster:

Note the **122.49MB/sec** and almost zero CPU while doing so!

Wow. This is easily the most noticeable speedup since the days of the Celeron 300A. The 256GB drives are currently a $585 premium on the Apple store, and even at that I cannot recommend them strongly enough. Programs and data just **snap** now, even sluggish stuff like the Komodo IDE, ipython, Firefox and Photoshop.

Don't wait for your next laptop, just buy an SSD for your current one and enjoy the ride.
