This is really a post about two things, so bear with me. Cast your mind back a few years to Bush's heyday and [Medicare Part D](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_Part_D), the infamous drug benefit. Due to pharma handouts and dishonest accounting [now coming to light](http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/03/26/beck.deficit/index.html), they couldn't afford real coverage and came up with the infamous 'doughnut' gap in coverage. From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_Part_D):


> The plan requires Medicare beneficiaries whose total drug costs reach $2400 to pay 100% of prescription costs until $3850 is spent out of pocket. (The actual threshold amounts will change year-to-year and plan-by-plan.) 


I have to assume that the soulless bastards who came up with this consciously refused to consider the human stories of suffering and tragedy it would inevitably cause. I consider this a prime example of 'getting captured by a large system and the rationalizations that ensue.'

Stories like... but I'm getting ahead of myself. The other thing this post is about is 'Weblogs that I enjoy'. Allow me to introduce you to the self-proclaimed '[Drugmonkey](http://drugnazi.blogspot.com/)', an anonymous, foul-mouthed, cynical, liberal pill peddler at some large pharmacy chain. He has most excellent stories and I highly recommend him. As with some of my favorite blogs, he gives you a glimpse into another world. The title of his blog is 'Your Pharmacist May Hate You', which gives you some idea of the content...

Today, I was clicked through to his site and reading some old stories when I found [this one](http://drugnazi.blogspot.com/2006/11/theres-woman-i-cant-get-out-of-my-mind.html). He used to call himself 'drugnazi', and it explains why he changed. **Go read it**; it'll simultaneously move you to tears and also to find the asshats of Part D for a serious beatdown.

'Compassionate conservatism,' my ass.
