The origins of watch collecting are rooted in the utilitarian. When the social time coordination instrument was the village clock, social units tended to cluster around the village square. With the rise of portable, reliable watches, the individual was freed to roam independently from the center of town, and yet remain in sync with the rest of humanity. Today, with the ready availability of completely automated, mass-produced electronic watches, the raison dâ€™etre of a fine mechanical timepiece no longer lies primarily in its timekeeping function. Today, the keystones to value in high mechanical timepieces are set in the perceived values of craft, the reconciliation of tradition and innovation, and their much more fascinating roles as a form of kinetic art and signatures of personal style.




An [interesting editorial on Worth.com](http://www.worth.com/Editorial/Money-Meaning/Passion-Investments/Watches-Jewelry/Watches-The-Value-of-Time-Print.asp) about watches. More oriented towards collectors and such, but has some interesting bits.
