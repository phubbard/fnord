In posting the previous story, I searched to see if I had posted this before. Surprisingly, I hadn't.

T-mobile has a website where you can see **detailed** coverage information, right down to cell tower placement and street-level detail. They are the only cell carrier to do so, and it's one of the reasons they still have my business. 

The website is [compass.t-mobile.com.](http://compass.t-mobile.com/) You'll quickly find that T-mobile is pretty urban, but if you can live with that I've been reasonably happy with them. They've also got the cheapest data plans ($20/month, vs $70 for Verizon).
