 If you're geeky enough to read the runes in the screenshot, you'll see   that usul (the phfactor.net do-everything Debian server) is now a   Pentium 4 621, 3.2 GHz dual-core, with 2GB of memory. I just upgraded   from a Athlon 64 3200+, 1GB, so this is a nice boost in capability.   About the only negatives are analog VGA onboard (no DVI), and 10/100   instead of gigabit. A spare 3c996 solved that, and my old monitor has   analog, so we're sorted. Do email or call if you see any oddities!
