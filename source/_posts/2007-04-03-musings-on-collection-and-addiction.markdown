From [a thread on SCWF](http://www.network54.com/Forum/78440/thread/1174512154/Grail+Watches------), an insightful post into the psychology of collecting. Here's a (long) snippet:




> 
Though the word has strong negative connotations, collection is akin to addiction: acquisition does not satisfy the craving. It appears to, but only briefly.

I began to realize that I was not collecting pens: I was collecting sensations of craving; I was collecting and trying to maintain certain mindstates: wonder, amazement, fascination, involvement, curiosity.

The problem however is that one confuses the mindstates with the objects. I realized that I don't love fountain pens per se; nor do I love watches per se. I love the wonder, amazement, fascination, involvement, and curiosity that is excited in my mind when I consider them, hold them, and use them.

That is why one grail is not enough: because it's not the object; it's the sensation associated with that object.

Realizing this allows me to approach watches with moderation, just as I have returned to fountain pens with moderation. That eternal and inevitable feeling of "lack" that can lead me to buy, to seek out, to wait for, to associate with an object (or heck, a woman, a book, a car, a bicycle, etc): that "lack" cannot be filled in any permanent way by an object. What I am after is not an object, ultimately, but a sense of wonderment. And I must find other ways to cultivate that sense of wonder, fascination, amazement, involvement, enchantment, and curiosity. The root of the issue is not the object, but the sensation. My collective impulse is not about what I collect. It's not about grails. Or fountain pens. Or watches. It's about my sense of connection to the day, to my life, and to an underlying feeling of lack, dissatisfaction – and, heck, maybe even fear about the passing of time.

This insight has saved me thousands upon thousands of dollars. It has in fact helped me feel content in the midst of all manner of discontent (not getting this or that outcome professionally, personally, intellectually, emotionally, etc).

That is why this forum for me isn't just about watches. It's about wonder, curiosity, joy, and the enriching of life through the disciplined appreciation of these shining and small machines. I’m new to Seikos – about five months into this thing – and because of the above insights, I have purposefully kept my "collection" at two Seikos. Instead of acquiring more, I have chosen (for once) to discipline my approach into this new hobby, and I do so by, well, musing about watches. I purposefully stopped and chose to use my fascination in Seikos and automatics in order to stop, pause, and study. I’m now trying to understand the technical and commercial history of watches, the changing conceptions of time throughout history, etc. I expect one day I may begin tinkering in their guts, like a lot of you have.

In the meantime, I’m trying to be very careful about cultivating a sense of craving for more watches. Because I know, from a past collection passion, that such craving is a bucket that cannot be filled. No grail will satisfy me. Wonder cannot be bought. I must find other ways to cultivate a mindstate of contentment and curiosity:

If I consider a watch or a pen to be the source and end of my wonder, I’m making a perceptual error.

The BM on my wrist as I type this is, frankly, awesome. But it’s awesome because it’s an *idea*, not an object.

I don’t confuse the two any more. And I’ve more money because of it! 




The entire thread is worth a read.
