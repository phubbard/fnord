As a followup to [my previous post](http://fnord.phfactor.net/2011/10/15/decent-wine-in-a-bag/), 
I found this at the local Costco yesterday:

![wine box](http://fnord.phfactor.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/29/IMG_0458.jpg)

2010 Bordeaux red, $25 for 3L. It's actually pretty good, an everyday wine and quite drinkable. 
For four bottles' worth the price is good, and if it keeps I'll be happy. Unlike before, the spout
isn't leaking, either.
