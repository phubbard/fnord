There are many ways to be happy. Here's a new one for me: My wife and   kind relatives banded together to get me the [TimeZone watch   school level 1](http://www.timezonewatchschool.com/WatchSchool/) and associated parts & tools. (ETA 2401, plus case,   and of course the watch tools.)

I felt like a kid again, newly able to Take Stuff Apart and Rebuild   It. Wonderful! So far I've done the most-basic bit, removing and   replacing 5 1.2mm screws from the two bridges. I've also peered into   my broken Molnija and a defunct Certina. This, my friends, promises to   be massively fun. 

I might actually have to lay off the coffee for this. How's that for   an evil choice?
