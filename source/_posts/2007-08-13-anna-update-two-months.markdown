Anna had her two-month checkup on Friday, and passed with flying colors. 10lbs 7oz, 23", 50th percentile for weight and 75th for height. She got four injections and one oral vaccine, for which she got a bit of Tylenol. The picture is to tide y'all over until the next album, and to make Diego happy - he liked the 'paul as furniture' series too.

In other news, **Anna is sleeping through the night!** At least, I'd say 11-7 (on a good night) counts. This is a huge relief for us, though Chris still gets less sleep due to waking up herself and sometimes night feeding. Me, I feel like a new man - those first few weeks were _rough._

As you can see, the cat is adapting nicely as well, took her a while but she's accepted her reduced status. More or less. I've done more cleaning up than before.

More pictures soon!
