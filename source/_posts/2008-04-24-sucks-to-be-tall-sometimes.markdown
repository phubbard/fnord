So I'm reading [this article](http://www.boingboing.net/2008/04/24/shoes-are-bad-for-yo.html) and [this article](http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/04/your-shoes-are.html) and [this post](http://gadgets.boingboing.net/2008/04/24/kevlar-shoes-encoura.html) and [this article ](http://www.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?action=cpt&title=You+Walk+Wrong&expire=&urlID=27990802&fb=Y&url=http%3A%2F%2Fnymag.com%2Fhealth%2Ffeatures%2F46213%2F&partnerID=73272)and [that review](http://urbansemiotic.com/2005/06/26/nike-free-50-review/), and mourning the loss of the current-model Merrell I'm wearing (out) right now, and thus enthused try to do some online shoe shopping. Maybe I can find a comfortable pair of shoes!

 

Nope. None of them are large enough to fit my flappin' feet. Even Zappos [disappoints](http://www.zappos.com/n/p/dp/38002311/c/138975.html). Maybe someone else will be helped, sigh.

Update: Mike suggests Eccos, as does my sister. We have a candidate! Thanks, Interweb.
