Not too bad for a cell phone camera, fuzzy with saturation problems but convenient. The originals are '3 megapixels' but that's a bit disengenuous.

This was from a short drive to [Oakoasis Park](http://www.co.san-diego.ca.us/parks/parklist.html#openspace) outside San Diego. We wanted to hike the one across the road, El Capitan, but it was basically closed.

More on [the N80](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2007/02/07/nokia-n80-review-and-notes/) as time permits...
