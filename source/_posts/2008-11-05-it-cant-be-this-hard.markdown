The situation: We have a home wiki installed on Debian using MoniWiki. MoniWiki has some limitations, a borked search engine and has generally been annoying me, so I want to change wiki software. Current leading candidate is MediaWiki, the basis of Wikipedia.

The problem: MoniWiki is filesystem-based, where each page is a file. MediaWiki is database-hosted. I can't find a **single** page on the net where someone moves the _contents_ of a wiki from one to another. It seems to be the classic captive-data trap.

Weak.

Any suggestions out there? The wikimatrix site suggests that there's a raw export for MoniWiki, but I can't find a mention of how to import same without cut and paste or similar.
