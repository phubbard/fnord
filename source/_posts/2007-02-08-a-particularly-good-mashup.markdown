Via [BB](http://boingboing.net/), the magnificent [Best of Bootie 2006](http://www.bootieusa.com/bestofbootie2006/) CD. (Free, MP3, what are you waiting for?) There's also [2005.](http://www.bootiesf.com/bestofbootie_2005)

Mashups are kind of a semi-new thing, dating back a few years. It seems to be the evolution of cross-fading and mix tapes to me, but judge for yourself. 

I like the whole disk, but track 9 really hooked me - 'Crazy Logic', a mashup of Gnarls Barkley, Supertramp and Rockwell. [(Direct link to song.)](http://images.davyn.multiply.com/song/1/59/full/U2FsdGVkX18ExsKC4ImPPt8OMo1UKPu6mKDfAjDB7Tir56JpDzHCEg==/09%20-%20Arty%20Fufkin%20-%20Crazy%20Logic.mp3)

The backbeat and main content of the track is 'Crazy', by Gnarls Barkley:

Having heard the un-mashed-up version, I think I want to get the album, [St Elsewhere.](http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:lztxlfaedcqr)

Mashups seem to be musical anchovies, either you'll love 'em or hate 'em. Go decide for yourself!
