[![Wing IDE logo](http://www.phfactor.net/wp-pics/coded_w_wing_large.png)](http://www.wingware.com/) I've been fiddling with Python off and on, and wanted to post a quick thank-you to the people at [WingWare.com](http://wingware.com/) for their policy of 'free licenses to open-source developers.' As with google code hosting, it's an enlightened worldview that makes my life easier and better. Hopefully I can return the favor to the world.



Anyway, I'm trying both [PyDev](http://pydev.sourceforge.net/) and [Wingware](http://www.wingware.com/), so if you need a Python IDE check 'em out.
