One of the annoying things about the mac clipboard is that it only stores one entry. When I'm writing something up, its often useful to have several URLs available. Until now, I had experimented with the commercial [iPaste](http://www.iggsoftware.com/ipaste/index.html), but didn't like it enough to keep past the trial.

I just found a free replacement called [Jumpcut](http://www.snarkout.org/projects/jumpcut/) that seems to work well. It puts a small icon on the menubar, with a dropdown list of entries. Clicking moves that entry into the clipboard for use.

Simple, free, unobtrusive - recommended.
