(Generation 2 X-33, ref 3291.50.00, picture from Omega.ch)

I've had an [off-again](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2006/08/30/another-x-33-alternative/), [on-again](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2006/05/16/omega-and-analog-digital/) [obsession](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2005/12/03/breitling-and-analog-digital/) with the X-33, a rather unusual watch from Omega. It's arguably the ne-plus-ultra of analog-digital watches, has some amazing features, and is rated for Mars. After all, that's where men are from, right?

(Alarms, loud enough at 80dB to be heard while flying, multiple timers, etc, etc. About the only negative is that it's not very water resistant, just 30m. Very marginal for lapswimming).

Anyway, it seems that Omega has discontinued it, which of course means that I want one even more now. According to [this page](http://ryanrooney.com/watch/X-33/) and [the experts on Timezone](http://forums.timezone.com/index.php?t=msg&goto=3164525&rid=49174#msg_3164525), I'd have to convince a friend at NASA or .mil to buy **ten** of them:


> The X-33 was discontinued in Summer 2006 for regular commercial retail sale but remains available to space programs like NASA and to military aviators through Omega's military pilot program. In addition to the military and professional input in the design phase, the watch became a favorite of many in fighter pilot  community especially. In 2006 under the Military Pilot Program cost was approximately US$650 on kevlar strap or US$800 on bracelet, with the kevlar strap available separately for an additional US$50. There was a minimum order quantity of 10 if using an existing caseback design or 15 for a new custom design. The watches can also be personalized with individual names/callsigns etc. for an additional $20. In exchange for the custom design and substantial discount (roughly 75% off MSRP) purchasers under the program must agree not to re-sell the watch for 5 years, though they still pop up on the secondary market now and then anyway.


Wow. I have a favor or two pending from friends, but buying ten swiss watches probably exceeds what I'm owed. On the plus side, if I **do** manage it, the price is $650 instead of $2,600... Nice discount, that.

  * [This excellent page](http://ryanrooney.com/watch/X-33/), which also explains in detail gen 1 vs gen 2, how to spot a fake, failure modes, and much more. Highly recommended.

	
  * [The official Omega page](http://www.omegawatches.com/index.php?id=297&details=1&ref=32915000&no_cache=1) for the X-33.

	
  * Emails to Omega went unanswered. This is the [second time](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2006/05/16/omega-and-analog-digital/) they've done that to me, I am unimpressed with their customer service.


**Update 12/9/07**: Several people (military) have sent emails to Omega and gotten no answer. I have to assume that it's no longer possible to get X-33s even in bulk. The official page now redirects, too. Serious bummer.

**Update 1/31/08**: I have one now, via Ebay, but it seems that the purchase program is still in effect for military pilots. I'll keep poking at this and see what I find; there are many comments from people so I think we could easily swing a block of ten.

**Update 2/27/08**: Hoisted from the comments, an explanation of why this'll never happen:


> Gents, I was provided with some information from the USN forums which may be of interest regarding Omega's X-33 Pilot/Astronaut policy:

*Minimum order 15 watches. Reorder minimum 10 watches.
* Each watch must have an identifying logo of your choice engraved on
the case back
* Only one watch per purchaser (pilot or astronaut), no orders for
friends, relatives etc.
* The pilot or astronaut must agree not to sell his/her watch for five
years (agreement attached to this email as a word for windows file)
* All watches are sent to one address for distribution
* Omega would like a photograph of some of the pilots wearing the Omega
for its museum in Switzerland (not to be used commercially without
permission)
* Each purchaser may use a personal check to pay for his/her watch.
Sorry, no credit cards accepted. Checks should be made out to Swatch
Group US. In memo line write "X-33 watch" and your squadron name.
* Delivery approximately 3 months after receipt of checks and forms by
Swatch Group US.
* The POC develops a list of purchasers with band preferences using the
blank Excel file and emails to the undersigned. POC must maintain
current mailing address and phone number with the undersigned so that the
shipping can be expedited (see attached blank Excel form).
The POC will be responsible for all security and insurance of the
watches once received.
* All FPO and foreign address orders are tax free, however, in the
event the shipping address changes, due to no fault of Omega, the squadron
must pay sales tax on the entire amount of the order at the percentage
rate charged at the new delivery address.


Rats. At this point I'm going to close comments, as the Omega avenue is a dead end and I don't want to raise anyone else's hopes. It sucks, but that's their policy for now.

**Update 8/10/08**: TickTalk posts this supercool video of an X-33 being disassembled and repaired... in zero-gravity! Click to check it out.
