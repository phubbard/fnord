I was talking to a co-worker about DNS registrars today, and ran whois on yahoo:


> 
whois yahoo.com
'
Whois Server Version 2.0

Domain names in the .com and .net domains can now be registered
with many different competing registrars. Go to http://www.internic.net
for detailed information.

Apparently, this has been going on for a while. I know that I get spam addressed to the email addresses in my whois records. The usual collection of bastards (Hi, Network Solutions!) that sell the whois access also sell another service to remove your email address from the record. Nice to work it both ways, eh?
Anyway, spam gets everywhere these days. Sad to see an old tool compromised.
