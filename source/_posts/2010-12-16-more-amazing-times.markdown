That's my new laptop, showing **four** CPUs. And **8GB** of memory. And _512GB of solid-state disk_.

[OMFG](http://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts-apparel/unisex/generic/810c/) but that's amazing. Even if the [Core i7](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_i7) isn't _really_ 4 separate CPUs, it sure does a great imitation of 'em.

Damn.
