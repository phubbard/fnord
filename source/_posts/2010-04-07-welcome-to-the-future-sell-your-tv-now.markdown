[![P1030724](http://fnord.phfactor.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/P1030724-450x337.jpg)](http://fnord.phfactor.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/P1030724.jpg)

[](http://fnord.phfactor.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/P1030724.jpg)For a while now, we've been using our iMac as a television, video chat box, movie screen and bittorrent server. (If you are hooked on a [Canadian sitcom](http://www.cbc.ca/littlemosque/), bittorent is [your best solution](http://ezrss.it/search/?show_name=Little+Mosque+On+The+Prairie&show_name_exact=true)). Netflix streaming is especially good, and even the Vancouver Olympics worked reasonably well.

(As an aside, I hope it's ok to be jealous of Anna. She's growing up with free video chats with grandparents, and iPhones. Add flying cars, and the Jetsons will be old news to this generation.)

Last night I was reading [the Ars Technica iPad review](http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2010/04/ipad-review.ars); another device I plan to get when I can convince Chris. Smack dab [on page ten](http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2010/04/ipad-review.ars/10) was news of [iPad/iPhone software](http://www.elgato.com/elgato/na/mainmenu/products/software/EyeTV-app.en.html) that, for $5, lets you view live or recorded TV_ on your handheld!_

Damn!

What's more, the hardware required (Elgato [eyeTV One](http://www.amazon.com/Elgato-EyeTV-Computer-Tuner-10020311/dp/B002XISW02/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1270658187&sr=8-1)) is under a hundred bucks!

You also need [an HDTV antenna](http://www.amazon.com/Terk-Amplified-High-Definition-Antenna-Reception/dp/B0007MXZB2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1270656945&sr=8-1), under $40, and [the iPhone software](http://www.elgato.com/elgato/na/mainmenu/products/software/EyeTV-app.en.html). Voila, free-ish TV!

I had a gift certificate for $100 for Amazon, so this'll be a present for Chris the PBS addict. ;)

Caveats:



	
  * Free channels are limited, and I don't know if the tuner will work with cable or satellite.

	
  * I suspect that we'll watch most of the shows on the iMac; the iPhone screen is too small to really enjoy it.

	
  * This may induce you to purchase an iPad as a better viewing device. This is My Evil Plan (tm).

	
  * Video files burn serious disk space. Might need a cheap USB drive to store them.

	
  * Unlike bittorrent, these recordings have the advertisements, sigh. Worth a google to see if I can find a solution for that.


On the plus side, one more reason to not bother buying a television.

PS I had some images to spice up this post, but WordPress is being problematic at the moment, will revise and add them later once I solve the problem.

PPS Sorted. Missing php libraries.
