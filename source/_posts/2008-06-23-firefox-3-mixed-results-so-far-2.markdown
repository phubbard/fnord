![](http://www.mozilla.com/img/press/firefox-logo_small.png)I've been using Firefox 3 since it came out, and still can't make up my mind about it. It's still got a bit of [an alien feeling](http://the.taoofmac.com/space/blog/2008/06/21/2305) about it, due to emulation of stuff like buttons, but the plugins are wonderful.  
  
([Scribefire](http://www.scribefire.com/) &  [AdBlock](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865) especially. The [new PDF viewer](http://code.google.com/p/firefox-mac-pdf/) is essential, too.)  
  
I had to reinstall [1Password](http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password), but that's no biggie, not hard to do. (Preferences in 1Password has an option to reinstall browser plugins.)   
  
On the minus side, Firefox appears to be incompatible with the bookmarklet for [Asaph](http://www.phoboslab.org/projects/asaph), which is a major problem. I _love_ my microblog, and the ultra-quick-posting ability of Asaph is addictive. Hmm.
