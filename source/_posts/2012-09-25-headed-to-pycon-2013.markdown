Yep, boss agreed and I get to go back to PyCon. [Last year was great](http://fnord.phfactor.net/2012/03/16/pycon-2012/) and I have high hopes for this year as well. 

I've also signed up for [the 5K FunRun](http://pycon.blogspot.com/2012/09/announcing-pycon-2013-5k-charity-fun-run.html) too and hope to see you there.
