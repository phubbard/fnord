I just yesterday finished recabling our trusty iMac for our toddler; all cables hidden or unreachable. Makes for a super clean setup:

I realized that this has been the computer that I've owned the longest (2008, all I've done is increase the memory from 2 to 4GB). Zero problems, tons of usage and just a fantastic, hassle-free machine. It's our [television](http://fnord.phfactor.net/2010/04/07/welcome-to-the-future-sell-your-tv-now/), [Transmission](http://www.transmissionbt.com/) server, FrontRow (plus [Understudy](http://code.google.com/p/understudy/) for Netflix), DVD player, iTunes server, game player, baby crib monitor and more. If and when it dies I'll get another one just like it.
