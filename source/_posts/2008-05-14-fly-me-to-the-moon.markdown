Yep, NASA is running a promo for their return to the Moon, where your name goes onto a computer chip. Nearly free for them, good PR, and kinda cool at the same time. Our entire family will be aboard, though this is the first they'll hear of it. ;)

Actually, you get a cool PDF with images and logos, nice piece of work:
