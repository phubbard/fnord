If you point your Blackberry's browser to mobile.blackberry.com, there are several free downloads for your enjoyment. Among them are several addictive games.

[This page lists four of them.](http://www.plazmic.com/en/games/index.shtml)

I've been seriously hooked on Rooster, which is a superb remake of Frogger. My high score is currently just over 1000, on the second space level.

[This page from RIM](http://www.blackberry.com/developers/journal/jan_2005/rooster_revealed.shtml) talks about the game and its development.

Free. Go get them all, play what you like. Highly recommended.
