One of my all-time favorite [CMJ](http://cmj.com/) disks was #29. Awesome discography, much better treasure/trash ratio than usual.

Anyway, one of the tracks is '[Rainfall](http://www.pacoahlgren.com/paco/05_TheBentleyTock_TheFirstEP_Rainfall.mp3)' by a group called Bentley Tock. Every now and then I'd google the name but never found much; tonight I hit the jackpot. According to [this blog post](http://www.jeffandwill.com/2007/07/06/friday-geek-out-the-bentley-tock/):


> Bentley Tock played around campus a lot, usually at a place called The Chukker (which sadly closed in 2003) and usually on Thursday nights. There were a lot of super late Thursdays (or early Fridays) when the band played. Me, Angela, Cheryl, Tracy, Billy and whoever else was up for it, would always show up. It didn’t matter to me if there was an exam, or if I had to work… if Bentley Tock was playing, I was there. Somewhere around the time I graduated in ‘91, the band packed up and headed to Austin to make a go of a bigger career. One CD came out, titled Able, but unfortunately not much came of it outside their home turf.


He links to [the website of Paco Ahlgren](http://www.pacoahlgren.com/about-discography.cfm), who turns out to have been the frontman for the group, and better yet **has posted all the songs for free**!!

So [go have a listen](http://www.pacoahlgren.com/about-discography.cfm) and see if you like 'em too. Can't beat free, and feel free to comment and denigrate my taste in music.
