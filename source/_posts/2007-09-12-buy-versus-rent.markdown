[![NYT calculator screenshot](http://www.phfactor.net/wp-pics/buy-vs-rent-wp.jpg)](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/10/business/2007_BUYRENT_GRAPHIC.html?ex=1189742400&en=4ca4e737ce32c4e4&ei=5070)




Superb calculator from NYT on buy versus rent. Configurable, too, for things like inflation, rate of return on investments, HOA fees, taxes, etc, etc.




But the best part is how intuitive it makes the decision. You can **see** the impact of appreciation and other variables on the spot. Magnificent!
