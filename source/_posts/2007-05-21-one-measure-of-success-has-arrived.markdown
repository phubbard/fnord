I got my very first solication to sell ads on this blog today. Oddly enough, it was for [this post](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2006/08/19/build-a-cat-tree-on-the-cheep) on building a cat tree. For some google reason, I get a lot of hits on that. Why me, and not the original? 

Not even my content, just a short paragraph linking to lifehacker. Bizarre.

S/he offered $35, not sure if was that a one-time or repeating. If that's per month, I'd be tempted. 

"pH Factor, brought to you by $SPONSOR."

Speaking of selling out, my [post on the new Rolex Milgauss](http://www.watchreport.com/2007/05/the_new_rolex_m.html) is up. The research on that one was pretty interesting.
