At first putting forth great effort to be sure that you have grasped the basics, then practicing so that they may come to fruition is something that will never stop for your whole lifetime. Do not rely on following the degree of understanding that you have discovered, but simply think, "This is not enough."




I've been carrying that around on the PDA for years, it's a remnant from a Palm document I was reading a long time ago. It made the transition to Blackberry and has been a seldom-seen note for a long time.

Wikipedia has [an excellent page on the Hagakure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagakure) with links to the text itself. 

The author and the current neocons have in common that they never fought. Given that, their similar viewpoints kind of make sense. Kind of.
