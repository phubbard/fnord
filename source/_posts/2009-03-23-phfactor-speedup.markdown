As of last night, you should be seeing a **big** speedup on all phfactor sites, from 40k/sec to 200. We're now hosted on AT&T u-verse service instead of Speakeasy.net. I love Speakeasy, but the economics are hard to argue with: Speakeasy was $90/month for 3.0/.768 (megabits/sec) and AT&T is 18/1 for $65! What's more, the DSL modem is showing that we're actually provisioned for 25/2 and speed tests confirm that's what I'm getting.

(Since that screenshot it got faster. When's the last time you saw _that_, eh?)

Anyway, we're also trying their bundled voice service, will post with results. So far, I'm pretty happy with U-verse and I'm really happy to finally get an increase from offsite as well. Hopefully it'll be as reliable as Speakeasy.
