[Preferably one of these](http://205.147.44.194/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=153&osCsid=b44eeb2a32cebf459d424a8c7418bcc1). $400, silent, 1U, with Compact Flash for hard drives. It'd make a killer box for OpenBSD. I really miss having pf and level-2 firewalling in place.

Nice for VoIP, too, since [you can use pf/altq](http://slacker.com/~nugget/asterisk4.php) to prioritize your VoIP traffic as well. Cool.
