[Doodle](http://www.doodle.ch/) is a free service that handles the routine work of scheduling a meeting - free time negotiation and the like. Sort of a bookmark here.

I'm also keeping an eye out for the next OSX version, which has some open-sourced calendar tools that are supposed to do similar things, but Doodle runs over email and HTTP and will therefore work for pretty much everyone.
