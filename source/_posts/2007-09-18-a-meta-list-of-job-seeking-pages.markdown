[This one](http://fortifyservices.blogspot.com/2007/08/definitive-job-hunt-story-so-far.html) has it _all_. And I do mean all.

Everything you ever didn't know that you needed to know about a jobsearch - from research to resume to interviews to new-job-skills, the works. A collected series of solicited essays from experts around the web. Kind of reminds me of what a college job placement service _could_ do for students if motivated and staffed right.

Hope you like it, Terri!
