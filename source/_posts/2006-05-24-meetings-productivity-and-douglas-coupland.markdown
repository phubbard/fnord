](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1596911042/qid=1148497338/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/102-1888230-6802529?s=books&v=glance&n=283155)

When a friend of mine first introduced me to [Generation X](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/031205436X/phfactor-20/102-1888230-6802529?%5Fencoding=UTF8&camp=1789&link%5Fcode=xm2), by Douglas Coupland, it was revelatory. Coupland at his best is a shrewd observer and compelling storyteller, and GenX is in my opinion his best work.

Anyway, I didn't like his later books nearly as much, but when I found this quote from [Jpod](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1596911042/qid=1148497338/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/102-1888230-6802529?s=books&v=glance&n=283155), I had to share it:


> Here's my theory about meetings and life: the three things you can't fake are erections, competence and creativity. That's why meetings become toxic--they put uncreative people in a situation in which they have to be something they can never be. And the more effort they put into concealing their inabilities, the more toxic the meeting becomes. One of the most common creativity-faking tactics is when somebody put their hands in the prayer position and conceals their mouth while they nod at you and say, "Hmmmmm. Interesting." If pressed, they'll add, "I'll have to get back to you on that." Then they don't say anything else".

Might have to read this one. Reviews on Amazon are mixed, but who knows?
