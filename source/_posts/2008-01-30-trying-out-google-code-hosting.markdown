I've been meaning to try out [Google Code](http://code.google.com/hosting/) and its project hosting, so today I setup a couple of projects there:



	
  1. [Awk code for line-counting C/C++](http://code.google.com/p/line-counting/)

	
  2. [New disk drive break-in Perl script.](http://code.google.com/p/disc-drive-flogger/)


Neither is large, super useful or likely to be changed soon, so the wiki/bugtracking/newsgroups features aren't super useful. I'm trying to setup a much more interesting project next, larger and C++ instead of scripting. Overall I was very impressed; it's a ton easier than the GForge equivalent I've been through many times.

One (large) caveat - there's currently a **lifetime** limit (!!) of **ten** projects. I'm going to ask for an increase before I spend too much time setting up projects, as ten isn't sufficient. Sure, I can use other google logins to get 'round the limit, but I shouldn't _have_ to.

They also limit downloads to 100MB total, max 20-32MB each. I've asked for a quota boost on a third project, we'll see there too.

I need to try sourceforge as well, but so far I'm very impressed - all very easy, clean interface, everything works, very snappy.

Oh yeah, these projects were previously (and still are) on my website, located [here](http://www.phfactor.net/code/).
