I don't know which order these will end up posted, due to the Postie   plugin, so commentary may mismatch...
The first is a no-parking sign, at the corner of a Jack in the Box   where the homeless often congregate. No love for the police, it would   seem.

The second, on a lamppost 3 blocks away, is a form of project I   never would have thought of: Make yourself presentable for the judge   after a marijuana arrest.
Makes sense, but the cynical side of me wonders who's paying and who   benefits. Or maybe its a genuine charity and life has worn me down a   bit. Either way, amusing.
