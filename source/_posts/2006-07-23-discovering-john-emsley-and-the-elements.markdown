I've [posted before about this](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2006/03/01/learning-about-the-elements/), but I have to admit that I find the elements fascinating. History, chemistry, science, alchemy all combined make for fascinating stories. Before, I posted about "Nature's building blocks," by John Emsley. While I was looking for him on Amazon, I found he's written a bunch of other books around the elements:

Damn. Too many books, and not enough time & money to read them all.
