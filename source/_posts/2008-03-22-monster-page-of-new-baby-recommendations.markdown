I wrote this up for an expectant friend, but it might be useful for others, [Pauls Page of New Parent Suggestions](http://www.phfactor.net/baby-needs/). Enjoy. Or at least be amused. It's a long list of items, ideas, recommendations and hints that was too long to 'blog. Diapers and pads, yes, but also LED lights and dive watches. Some attempted humor, some cussing, dozens of pictures and even more links. Note that all the stuff on the page represents the results of obsessive geek research, so figure that everything we recommend is our best choice.

Oh yeah, the picture is of my nephew, always liked that one.
