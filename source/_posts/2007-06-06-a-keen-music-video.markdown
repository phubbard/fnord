Via [VSL](http://www.veryshortlist.com/lists/pick.cfm?email_key=55bcbded-b967-4290-9538-0012905279c1), a pointer to a cool music video, done with dice as pxels. Check out a screenshot above, and then check it out. Note that the actual QuickTime file is at [this URL](http://www.factoryfilms.net/films/quicktimes/FuyijaMiyagi_AnkleInjury.mov) if you want to download it. Kind of a catchy tune.
