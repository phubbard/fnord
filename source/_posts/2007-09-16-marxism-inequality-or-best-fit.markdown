![Toys for everyone!](http://www.phfactor.net/wp-pics/his-n-hers-wpa.jpg)


We just replaced Chris's ancient Palm V (actually a clone, the IBM version we got from woot.com) with a new [Palm Z22](http://www.amazon.com/Palm-1048NA-Z22-Handheld/dp/B000BI2180/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-4858399-7534239?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1190132156&sr=8-1). Here it sits, on its first charge, next to [my iPhone](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2007/09/15/bandwagons-timing-and-folly/) box, and I had one of those 'his and hers' pictures to take.

Did spur a bit of thought, though. Chris is actually _sane_ about gadgets, and they don't do as much for her as they do for me. I still feel guilty about the cost difference, since the Z22 is about $80 on Amazon these days. It's a great unit, though, and I wish they had shipped something like it years ago. Inexpensive, durable, plenty of memory, color screen, small and light.

For me, I'll be curious to see how the iPhone fares as a PDA. I've been impressed so far with the calendar and addressbook, but am peeved that Notes don't sync and there's no built-in to-do list. We shall see!
