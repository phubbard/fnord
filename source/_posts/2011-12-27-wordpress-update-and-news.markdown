I've just updated the site from wordpress 2.8 to 3.2, hopefully nothing broke but do let me know if it glitches. I'm currently messing with [Octopress](http://mattgemmell.com/2011/09/12/blogging-with-octopress/) and [exitwp](https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp); may go the static route after good results on a test site I created.
