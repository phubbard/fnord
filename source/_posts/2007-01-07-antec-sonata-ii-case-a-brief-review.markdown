I wanted to quiet the howl of the server since I [added the new RAID5 disks](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2006/11/11/hardware-and-software-raid5-under-linux/). Seems that the three disks have enough difference in spindle RPM that they, in concert, produce an awful beat frequency noise, sort of a moo or howl. Sounds like 60Hz modulated at about .25Hz; really really annoying.

Added on top of that was the 80mm fan noise, and the room was noisy. We have a small house, and one useless room is a problem. I set out, with my mad google skills, to solve it.

I ended up converging on the [Antec Sonata II](http://www.antec.com/us/productDetails.php?ProdID=15139#) case. Transverse-mounted drives on rubber grommets, a duct for CPU and video card, 120mm case fan with 3-speed switch, smart PS fan, etc, etc. They cost about $130 new, but here's the good news: Antec sells 'B-stock' cases for **$51.98!** With shipping, its around $73.

Well, it's a PC case, it's gonna get scratched soon anyway, so B-stock is A-OK with me. I ordered one, it arrived a week or so ago, and I spent a half-day setting it up. Notes and review follow!

First off, did I mention that it's cheap?

The case finish is shiny, also known as piano or lacquer. Quite nice. Two lights up front for power and drive, plus on-all-the-time blue LEDs in the front. I hacked the plug and connected the power LED to the RAID card; if the blue lights are on I hardly need another green-colored confirmation.

Parts went into the case easily, well made and solidly built. All edges are rounded, all the parts required are included, quite nice. Here's a shot or two of the result:

That's 3x RAID disks plus one for the OS. 

It's not as quiet as I had hoped (since the box claims 'silent') but it's much improved from the old mid-tower. The reduced size is also a plus, and the price was right. I still get the beat frequency noise, and am at a loss how to fix it. The rubber drive grommets appear to be less effective than required, which is kinda annoying.

Overall, it's a nice case, very pretty and quieter than average. Recommended, especially if you get the B-grade discount.
