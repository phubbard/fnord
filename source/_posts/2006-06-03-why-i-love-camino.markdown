A couple of weeks ago, I started using [Camino](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/camino/) for web browsing. It's a mac-native browser based on the Firefox engine.

I really like it. Faster than Firefox, much more mac-native as far as integration, look-n-feel, widgets, Keychain integration, etc. 

Works well, renders more stuff than the KHTML-based browsers, free, highly recommended.
