Somehow, I really picked up the taste for carbonated water while travelling to Diego's wedding. The carbonation adds a little zip and zing that I like, and the lack of sugar also appeals. I tried bottled water for a while, but the appalling waste of recycling plastic bottles for every 1.25l was too much. So I did some net-research and found a [soda siphon](http://http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002COPS4/103-4858399-7534239): (also spelled syphon, or called a seltzer bottle)

 It works pretty well, and the waste is just a 5cm CO2 canister that (hopefully) recycles easily. So far, so good, if you discount the siphon arriving with missing parts that required two weeks to find and get.

Of course, before the parts even _arrived_ there was [a post on Cool Tools](http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/001818.php), explaining how to make your own for even cheaper and simpler. Damn!

 All thing considered, I'll just use the siphon for a while. If I develop an unquenchable thirst, maybe the CoolTools setup will be required.
