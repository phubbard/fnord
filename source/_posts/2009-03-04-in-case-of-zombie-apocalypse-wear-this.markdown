For some reason, I remembered the "[I am Legend](http://iamlegend.warnerbros.com/)" Will Smith zombie flick this morning as I rode the shuttle bus to work. One of the plot elements is, of course, the importance of being off the street before sunset. Allow me to suggest, should Zombies Attack, wearing one of these:

Normally used by photographers and such, it has an alarm that sounds 15 minutes before sunrise and sunset. Being a Yes watch, it knows how those times change as the seasons change, so you'll never be caught on the street when the zombies emerge.




You're welcome.
