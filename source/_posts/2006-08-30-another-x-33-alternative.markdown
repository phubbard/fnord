In my [initial look at flying watches](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2005/12/03/breitling-and-analog-digital/), I drooled on the Omega X-33. ([Later, too.](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2005/12/03/watches-for-flying/)) As you can see, the Pulsar is a pretty close copy:


![Real Omega](http://www.phfactor.net/pics/watches/x-33-gen1.jpg)The Pulsar is model PK2003, looks like its been recently discontinued. Hmm. The PMWF review was so-so, but they _are_ cheap. Looks like some of the flight-specific stuff got lost (e.g. 80dB alarm), but since I'm grounded that'd be OK. There's also a reverse LCD version.

Hmm. Also pushes my 'analog/digital' button.
