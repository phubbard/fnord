I've now added [Google analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) to the site, meaning that the header for the blog now has 2 Google javascript links. If this bothers you, please contact me and/or block contacts to www.google-analytics.com.

I don't think it's a problem - the data is anonymous, and the information is tremendously interesting to me. I'll be posting snapshots here once some accumulate.
