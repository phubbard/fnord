The two-seater buggy has unique capabilities: it can be dropped from high altitude, fly stealthily a few dozen miles under its own power and land on a postage stamp. Pack away the parafoil and it's a ground vehicle capable of 60 mph.

After the job is done comes the clever part. With fifty yards of rough track it can get airborne again and head back.




It should go without saying that there is little I would not sacrifice to have one of these.
