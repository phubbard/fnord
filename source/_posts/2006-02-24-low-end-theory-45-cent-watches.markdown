Well, up to ten dollars, actually. A nice essay on how watches are now [sold out of quarter vending machines.](http://us.gizmodo.com/gadgets/columns/low-end-theory-156543.php)

It goes to show that [retrocomputing is the correct metaphor](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2005/10/28/retrocomputing-and-mechanical-watches/) for watches. The problem of timekeeping has been solved, the solution essentially zero-cost. All that remains is nostalgia, quixotic obsession and personal amusement.

Works for me.
