The author puts it best:

My name is Alana, and I live in Scotland. I'm an American, and I've heard all the cultural stereotypes about British food*, so I thought I would take the time to try a variety of British foods, drinks and dishes, and report on whether or not they really are all that bad. The plan is to eat one new food per week, but that plan may vary.



The [reviews](http://www.girlalive.com/food/index.html) are concise, the food described often peculiar and it's all _very_ well-written and funny. Enjoy!

A sample from [the Marmite review](http://www.girlalive.com/food/028.html):

Okay. I have to do this now. It is absolutely foul and it won't come off my teeth. Help! Where is water? I need water! Okay, so I can't finish the cracker. It is all the worst flavors in the world, concentrated into one devil-spawn foul mix. The texture is like really sticky smoker's lung. Only stickier. It is salty and sour and bitter all at the same time. I think I may cry.
