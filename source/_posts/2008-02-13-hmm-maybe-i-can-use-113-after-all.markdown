![](http://www.phfactor.net/wp-pics/sim-stealth.jpg) One of the recurring gotchas with an unlocked iPhone is that the newer features re-lock the phone every time. Because of that, I've kept mine at version 1.0.2, which works pretty well but lacks some newer niceties. The [poor-mans-GPS](http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/index.html#map) is the one I really want.

Anyway, I keep an eye on the hacking progress, and there are ways of updating to at least 1.1.2, but they're hairy and kinda iffy. Getting old, I guess, and less time available to hack.

Yesterday I was reading an [article in BusinessWeek](http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/feb2008/tc20080211_152894.htm) about the iPhone grey market, and there was a URL that caught my eye. I knew that there was a hardware hack called [TurboSim](http://www.bladox.com/) that would also work. The idea is different than [a software hack](http://www.iphonesimfree.com/cgi-bin/iphonesimfree/engine.pl?page=home): the SIM chips sits on a module that lies to the phone about what SIM it has. Clever, eh?

The TurboSim was $110, so I dismissed it. Now, however, the BizWeek article links to [PDACable](http://www.pdacable.com/servlet/the-56/iphone-unlock-1.1.2-next/Detail), which has the same chip, now made in China, for $19.99. Now **that's** more like it. If it works as promised, you just have to jailbreak and not unlock, a much easier prospect without the issue of baseband firmware.

Mine's on the way. I'll let you know.

**Update 2/19/08**: [Save your money](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2008/02/17/with-fear-and-trembling-the-iphone-update-hack/) and use iJailbreak instead.
