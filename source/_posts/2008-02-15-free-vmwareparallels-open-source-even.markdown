Via [ArsTechnica](http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2008/02/14/virtualbox-move-over-parallels-and-fusion-its-sizzlean), news of a free open-source PC emulator for OSX called [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org/).

Right now, it only runs on Intel-based macs, but I gave it a quick test with [DamnSmallLinux](http://damnsmalllinux.org/) and it runs quite well. I'm impressed, and will experiment more with it. It's really amazingly polished for OSS, professional as hell.

Excellent news, this. Screenshot of DSL running with Firefox:
