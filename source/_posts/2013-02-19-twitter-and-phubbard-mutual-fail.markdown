So I've been [phubbard on Twitter](http://twitter.com/phubbard) since [2007 or so](http://fnord.phfactor.net/2007/03/13/twitter-a-web-20-way-to-kill-time-and-attention/) Just a bit shy of six years.

Earlier this month (Feb of 2013), [Twitter got hacked](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/02/twitter-hacked/all/1) and lost
250 thousand accounts. Or so. Apparently, mine was one of them.

So starting on the second, when I tried to login to the website, it required that I reset my password. And there the problems started.

I have a lot of email accounts. In 2007, I was working for sdsc.edu; but it wasn't sent there. Nor my phubbard@computer.org (IEEE), phubbard@acm.org (ACM), home email, gmail, or even my mailbucket.org account, worked. I have no dang idea, and that's quite unusual for me. Email archives are barren in this regards, suggesting that I may have used a temporary address.

Yeah, oops indeed. It gets better.

You can request a reset via email address or username. Neither works. Or cell phone - but I've never tied my phones to Twitter, so no help there either.

The twitter tech support was pretty blunt:

	Hi,

	Sorry, but we are unable to verify you as the account holder. Please note that an email address can only be associated with one Twitter account at a time. Support cannot tell you what email address is associated with an account nor send password information to an alternate email address. 

	If you're unable to access the exact email (or verified mobile device) for this account, we can't continue troubleshooting this issue. You might consider contacting your email provider for help getting back in to an old or inactive email account. Here is some contact information for common email providers: http://support.twitter.com/articles/107907 

	Even if you mistyped your email address on signup, we require that you write to us from the exact address that is tied to the account.

	Unfortunately, if you don’t have access to this account’s email address or verified mobile device, we are unable to assist you in regaining access to this account. There are no security questions you can answer nor additional information you can provide as proof of ownership.

	While we understand that it can be disappointing when you lose access to an account, we use these verification requirements to make sure we don’t give out any user information to the wrong person. 

	If you'd like to create a new account, you can do so here: https://twitter.com/signup

	Again, I'm really sorry.

Really, Twitter? I had asked them to *tell me the email address I used*. They won't. That's pretty fucking annoying. 

BUT IT KEEPS GETTING BETTER!

You see, Twitter uses Oauth, so clients I authorized before this mess stil work. I can tweet from my phone, and probably other clients as well. I'd be happy to tweet a code or something to validate. But no.

So I'm debating. I might setup another account. Or decamp to app.net, already have phubbard there anyway. Since this clusterfuck I can't even login to download my tweet history, which is really sad. 5k or so, some of which would have been very nice to have a record of.

My fault? Yes, I should have updated my email and (arguably, I don't see much value in SMS) my cell. But Twitter's handling of *their security failure* is the proximate cause, and their rigid procedures have screwed me.
