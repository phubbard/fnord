Watchismo has an amazing writeup of Bond and his watches throughout the movies. I'm not sure what my favorite is, maybe the '62 Submariner.

Bond. And watches. Maaahvelous. It may be shallow of me, but I'm looking forward to the 'Casino Royale' that's coming out in a week or so. We used to call films like these "McDuffs" after a notorious prof at UNM. We all bottom feed sometimes.
