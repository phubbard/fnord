As a late addition to [the PSP page](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2006/07/08/synergy-psp-video-encoding-and-xgrid/), this munificent cable. Seven bucks, lets you charge the PSP from your laptop while on the road. Just got mine, works fine, a must-have. One less AC adapter to pack!

Update 5/6/07: Yeah, the picture is wrong, but its the same one on the Madcatz site, sorry. The actual cable is a Y, where the USB flat (A) connector forks into PSP power (barrell) and USB mini.
