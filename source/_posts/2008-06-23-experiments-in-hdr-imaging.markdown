I've posted [about HDR before](http://fnord.phfactor.net/2007/07/09/aperture-hdr-and-more-about-the-new-camera/), the idea is to combine multiple exposures into a single image with a wider range of light and dark. Here's my first attempt, using the Fuji camera, a tripod and the 1 f-stop auto bracketing. Processed in Photoshop CS3's HDR code:

Yep, that's my [Marinemaster](http://fnord.phfactor.net/2006/12/26/the-seiko-marinemaster-page/) all right! (Click for enormous version)

Notes:



	
  * I had to shoot in JPEG mode, as the Fuji won't bracket in RAW mode. This reduces the quality quite a bit, and is super annoying.

	
  * The Fuji's bracketing is limited to +- 1 f-stop, and 2.5 or 3 would produce better results. I'll try it by hand and see if it's worth the trouble. Hand-setting the f stop and such is hard to do without moving the camera, and that ruins the result.


I'm still pretty happy with the result, quite professional looking in my opinion.
