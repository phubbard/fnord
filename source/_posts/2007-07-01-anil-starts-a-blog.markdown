My good friend Anil Somayaji from [UNM](http://www.unm.edu/) has started [a blog!

The ](http://somaspace.net/ei/)[first post](http://somaspace.net/ei/archives/2007/7/1/the_complex_life_of_bad/) up is about why software is bad:



> 
So, even knowing the benchmark, we have failed to give computers the qualities that we want. In earlier days we could say that computers aren't big or fast enough; we no longer have that excuse. We can produce software that runs on hundreds of thousands of computers, that processes petabytes of information in mere seconds - in a real sense, they do things that are humanly incomprehensible. But we still can't make software that is "human" in any meaningful sense.




Anil's a CS professor at [Carleton](http://www.scs.carleton.ca/~soma) and a very bright guy. I expect that this will be an interesting blog to read.
