In the [main apps review page](http://www.phfactor.net/bb/bundled_apps.html) I said that the OS4 apps had category support. True, they do. However, after using it for quite I while, I have to say that they blow compared to PalmOS.

Much harder to find/use/create. One of the virtues of the palm was the easy of switching categories, and the blackberry lacks this. They're effectively useless.
