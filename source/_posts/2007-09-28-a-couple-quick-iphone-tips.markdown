First off. As previously complained about, the iPhone has a skinny little space for the headphone jack, so most 'phones don't fit. The adapter sold in Apple stores is a brain-dead design that sticks out like this:

 Bound to break the phone sooner or later, and bulky to boot. So, I searched [iLounge](http://www.ilounge.com/) for alternatives and found [the Griffin version](http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/ipod/review/griffin-headphone-adapter-for-iphone/):

A bit pricy at ten bucks, but a superior solution. I will probably end up getting one so I can use existing headphones, car adapter, etc.
Second tip: eBay's pages take forever to load on the iPhone, try [http://www.iphonemyebay.com/](http://www.iphonemyebay.com/) instead. Officially approved by eBay, for whatever that's worth.
