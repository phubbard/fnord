For some reason, we've had a very hard time with what seems a simple task. Our Lumix cameras take SD cards, and simply transferring them to the computers has been a serious pain in the neck.

[This card](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002WE4HE2):

Nothing fancy, we thought.

[This reader](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00153I81O) did not work at all, DOA:

[This one](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028Y9BX8) sort of works, sometimes:

The built-in readers on the Macbook Air **and** Macbook Pro had the same problem -- just don't seem to see the card when its inserted. Timing? Bad hardware? [SD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital) versus [SDHC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital#SDHC)?

Super puzzling, since the cameras are more tolerant and the only way to get images is to use the camera download cable; kind of a pain.

Today I found [one that seems to work](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NS828K) reliably, six bucks:

I'll update this post if it flakes out too, but for now we may have found a winner.
