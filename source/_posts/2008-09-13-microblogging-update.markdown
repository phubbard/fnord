So it's been a few months since I started experimenting with [Twitter](http://twitter.com/phubbard) and [Asaph](http://asaph.phfactor.net/) (microblog), and the results are kind of interesting. Similarly to how architecture affects our behaviour, the designs of these two have changed how I blog here at Fnord. To wit:

Twitter is, of course, all about short posts, 140 characters or less. It's ideal for impressions, brief wit and small updates. Combined with a URL shortener like tr.im, you can sort of microblog on it, but that doesn't work as well. As others have noted, Twitter really excels at keeping up with your friends and family, hearing the little trivia and minutia that keep us connected. 

Asaph similarly allows posting a paragraph or so of text, or a scaled image. No space for wit, but excellent for a fast way to share interesting links/sites. 

The software affects the usage, too. On the desktop, I use MoodBlast, which is hotkeyed, so you can Twitter in 15 seconds or less; quite handy. There are also several good iPhone clients, I use Twitteriffic and like it. Very convenient.

Asaph is accessed via a bookmarklet, so I only use it from the desktop.

I've got accounts on others services (Plaxo, Facebook, LinkedIn, not sure what all else) but for me Twitter and Asaph work best.

In a way, this post is an explanation of why I've posted less (short stuff goes elsewhere now), a review of the services, and a long-winded way of saying 'keep an eye on [my Twitter page](http://twitter.com/phubbard) and [microblog](http://asaph.phfactor.net/) if you want another way to keep in touch.' 

Another reason that I thought to write this is [a surprisingly good piece on NYT Magazine](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/07/magazine/07awareness-t.html) about Twitter - highly recommended.
