I got asked the obvious question today of where the weblog title came from. Short answer: Robert Anton Wilson, as vaguely remembered by someone who never read the books.

To quote [the Wikipedia entry:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fnord)


> 
"Fnord" has become a popular word with followers of Discordianism. It is often used in Usenet and other computer circles to indicate a random or surreal sentence; coercive subtext, or anything jarringly out of context (intentionally or not), can be labelled "fnord".



I guess that's sorta kinda what I had in mind. Or not. I had in mind something like "There's nothing to see here, move along."

Guess I'll have to read the books now.
