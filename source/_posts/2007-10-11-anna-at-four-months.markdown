We took her in for the four-month pediatrician visit this week. She's 14lbs 3oz, 25", putting her above median on both height and weight. That's the good news.

Bad news - infection requiring antibiotics twice daily for two weeks, plus a raging 36-hour fever from the four shots plus oral vaccination. Oh yeah, and a couple of weeks of estrogen-based ointment for a gender-specific ailment. It's been grim, and Chris had to stay home Wednesday to take care of her. Better now, thankfully.

Here's a couple of pictures to enjoy. First off, Anna post-innoculation, where the paracetemol has taken effect:

Second, crashed this morning, sleeping much more soundly:

It's a good thing she's cute while sleeping, 'cause for a while there sleep was in very short supply, as was good humor all around. ;)
