![BeOS5 in Parallels](http://www.phfactor.net/wp-pics/beos.jpg)


This is, alas, as far as BeOS5 will get in booting under [Parallels](http://www.parallels.com/en/products/workstation/mac/). Ubuntu runs really well though, and next up is Win2k - I prefer that for virtual machines. Runs much faster than XP, and I don't have to deal with the hassle of transferring the license from my now-defunct XP install under VirtualPC.

I despise copy protection most of the time, but XP's 'Genuine Advantage' is one of the biggest pains in the ass.
