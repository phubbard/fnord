![My feet and the wing of a PA-28-181](http://www.phfactor.net/wp-pics/wing.jpg)

This is me, pre-flighting the [N4419F Piper](http://foxflying.com/Archer19FPhotos.htm) at [DuPage aiport](http://www.airnav.com/airport/KDPA) ([FBO link](http://www.dupageairport.com/)), part of the [Fox Flying Club](http://foxflying.com/) fleet. Very good times.(Note, however, that the Merrell Pulse II's I'm wearing are a sad, sad, followon to the magnificent Pulse I's. Absolute crap by comparison. I wore my originals on four continents, in _all_ sorts of weather, and loved them. You can't buy them anymore, and the P2 sucks hard - uncomfortable, badly fitting, laaaame.)

Anyway. If you're in Chicagoland, check out the [flying club.](http://foxflying.com/) Best prices anywhere (non-profit) and a really nice bunch of guys joined by their love of flight.
