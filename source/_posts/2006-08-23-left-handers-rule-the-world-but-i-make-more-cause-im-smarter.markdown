If ever there was a post better matched to Chris and I, I've not seen it. This one covers the continued world domination of the sinister handed, and that "taller people earn more because they are smarter."

[Freakonomics, of course.](http://www.freakonomics.com/blog/2006/08/23/left-handers-continue-to-rule-the-world/) I love their blog, econ continues to produce interesting and counterintuitive results.

Update 5/07: I got a nasty submitted comment that took this as an insult. It's not; it's merely a pointer to research that indicates that I'm overpaid due to height.
