Via [BoingBoing](http://www.boingboing.net/2007/04/14/why_you_should_wear_.html), an [excellent post](http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/008845.html) by a paramedic on newtonian physics, seatbelts and NJ governor Corzine:

Do you know how we can tell the difference between people who were wearing their seatbelts and those who weren’t, at the scene of an automobile accident? The ones who were wearing their seatbelts are standing around saying “This really sucks,” and the ones who weren’t are kinda just lying there.




The comments are amazing - this is a long page, but really worth reading. [The Bastard Stop](http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/008845.html#180570) in particular:

Back in college, a few of my more invincible friends would stubbornly refuse to wear a belt. To counter this I developed a simple technique called the 'Bastard Stop' which would quickly affirm the importance of seatbelts to my passengers... Just after you pull away (doing no more than a walking pace) slam on the anchors. Once they've clambered out of the footwell, they'll generally comply.

The technique got it's name for obvious reasons and makes an excellent demonstration of newtonian physics.
