A sometimes profane but quite thoughtful essay on vegetarians, with some interesting conclusions:


> Vegetarianism is the new Puritanism. This is my belief. It is also one of my arguments against vegetarianism, and although it may at first seem a flippant argument, I believe that it is very powerful. Vegetarianism is miserable. It attacks one of lifeâ€™s greatest and surest pleasures - enjoying good food. Anything which makes people less happy is bad.


[The essay is here](http://www.hyperactive-stage.co.uk/blog/comments.asp?ref=196) in cached form; the original was censored and the author basically fired. Another indicator of a cult/religon, or something like that.
