![Sun server](http://www.phfactor.net/wp-pics/t2000.png)


For some reason or other, I was reading [an entry on Jonathan's Schwartz's weblog](http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan) the other day, which led me to [this page.](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonathan/20060224)Which says, nay _urges_ you to borrow a Sun server for 60 days. **Even as an individual!** Usually, you gotta be corporate IT to get this kind of offer.The machines are best suited for multithreaded apps with little FPU; I have several I want to test. Between this and an unrelated winning of a drawing, I'm feeling rather benevolent towards Sun right now. Haven't had this much fun since the days of a roomful of Sun gear...[](http://www.phfactor.net/pics/abq-9x/mvc-040f.jpg)[ ](http://www.phfactor.net/pics/abq-9x/mvc-040f.jpg)

 That was from undergrad/grad, when we'd get surplus gear from Sandia/LANL auctions. If you squint, there's an SGI Iris, a Sparc 2, Sparc LX, several sparc printers (the first winprinter, which is not praise), DEC SCSI enclosures, a seven-channel oscilloscope, my Freebsd x86 box, and of course the trusty 56k modem that was my lifeline to the world. Ahh, good times.More recently I had this setup all nicely stacked up:

(That was in Illinois, where I used LXs for servers. Note the kalpana, the very first ethernet switch!)

This T2000 box is 2U, 16 physical/32 virtual CPUs, up to 64GB of memory, quad gig ethernet. Its a pocket supercomputer, really. Amazing times that we live in!

Anyway, it's a nice offer, so do consider it if they'd meet your needs. I'll be posting benchmarks as I get them.

**Update**: I was looking for a better picture, and found that Sun has an _entire site_ of product photos! [Go and be amazed.](https://photos.sun.com/index.jsp)
