I've been an [RSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) fan for [years](http://fnord.phfactor.net/2007/05/08/an-essay-on-rss/) now, and with the advent of the [iPhone](http://fnord.phfactor.net/category/iphone/)/Google Reader combo I read even more. I used to use [NetNewsWire](http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NetNewsWire/Default.aspx), but by using [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/) I'm always in sync on mobile and desktop. Their iPhone interface is really good, even on EDGE data rates.

Yesterday, I checked out [Google Reader Trends](http://www.google.com/reader/view/?page=trends), and found the following:

Umm, that's a lot, right?

Kinda interesting. What I'm finding is that the iPhone allows me to do short newsfrouping sessions when I have a few spare minutes, so I end up reading more than I did before. I also _really_ like that the load of loading feeds and pages is moved to Google, resulting in less laptop/PDA CPU usage and faster overall performance. It is, in a word, **magnificent**.

Even if you don't have an iPhone or iTouch, Google Reader is still most excellent. If you do, fire up Safari and start keeping up with more of the world than previously possible!

Highly recommended.

P.S. I have several hundred feeds, with an unusual organization that I plan to post later. I'm also happy to share the list with you in OPML format if you want to jump-start your Reader setup.

Update: Here's reading by time of day and day of week. Lots of late-night!
