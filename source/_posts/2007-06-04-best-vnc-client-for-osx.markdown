...Via [this ADC thread](http://lists.apple.com/archives/remote-desktop/2005/Mar/msg00126.html), news of the spiffy [VNCThing](http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/9261&vid=6708), a rather nice client. Homepage seems to be lost-domained, but the software seems to work pretty well. I guess it's greedy of me to wish that [CoRD](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2007/05/22/better-remote-desktop-client-software/) would add VNC support...
