Yes, I **am** clearing out my to-do list of postings today, why?

Anyway, [Lifehacker tells us](http://lifehacker.com/software/television/abc-streams-full+length-episodes-in-high-def-287561.php) that the following are now free from ABC:


> Fat March, Brothers & Sisters, Ugly Betty, Desperate Housewives, Grey's Anatomy, Men in Trees, American Inventor, The Nine, Lost, According to Jim, Shaq's Big Challenge, The Fashionista Diaries, Voicemail, Six Degrees, October Road, Daybreak, What About Brian, Knights of Prosperity, and The Bronx is Burning.


Most of those are, as usual, deeply and profoundly pointless, but hey! If one floats your boat it's now [easier to find than ever before.](http://lifehacker.com/software/television/abc-streams-full+length-episodes-in-high-def-287561.php)
