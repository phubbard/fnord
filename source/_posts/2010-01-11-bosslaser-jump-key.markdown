$23 and a new toy is on the way:

I'm thinking of binding it to [the laser jump in Nexuiz](http://fnord.phfactor.net/2009/12/03/a-quick-nexuiz-tip/), and maybe setting it up as a boss key at work. ;)

Just kidding. My monitor is visible from outside my office, so boss keys aren't useful. I'm quite curious to see if I can add feet to a FPS game and have it work - Mom used to play the pipe organ, and I suspect that adding another limb to the action will increase the immersiveness of the game.
