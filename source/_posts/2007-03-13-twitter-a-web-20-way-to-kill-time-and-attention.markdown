OK, based on [this blog post](http://many.corante.com/archives/2007/03/10/twitter_tips_the_tuna.php) I decided to check out [Twitter.](http://twitter.com)

Kind of an RSS feed for your (nerdier) friends. Signed up, no problems. (Username is [phubbard](http://twitter.com/phubbard))

Next up, an easier way to get and send updates. For sending updates, install and use the Applescript+Quicksilver from [this page.](http://blog.codahale.com/2007/01/15/tweet-twitter-quicksilver/) That allows superfast updates with no client software. 

(For the blackberry, I just added twitter@twitter.com to my Google IM list, so I can use the IM program. Or SMS. Both pretty easy.)

After that, I want to use [Growl](http://growl.info/) for others' updates. (I'm also gonna try RSS, depending on how it goes.) Haven't got this up yet, but here are some links I'm reading:




  1. [One program](http://blog.nbwd.co.uk/2007/3/2/squawk-twitter-growl-notifications)

  2. [Another](http://al3x.net/entries/766)

  3. [Another, also claims QS](http://www.sauria.com/blog/2007/01/18/growlified-tweet/)



See also [this excellent page](http://slackermanager.com/2007/03/the-several-habits-of-wildly-successful-twitter-users.html) on the several habits of highly effective Twitter users.

Dunno how useful Twitter is or will be, but I'm entertained for now. Might also put my latest status on the blog, for example. Feel free to add me or post a comment on how you use it.
