One of the really useful applications on the Blackberry is a password manager. It's part of the base OS as of version 4, storing passwords in an AES-encrypted database. Even if you lose the Blackberry, your passwords/PINS/sekrets are safe.

Oddly, the iPhone has no equivalent. Even the free software out so far doesn't have one. I'm debating trying to code one up myself, which if I reuse code might not be too hard. Hmm.

Only thing I've found so far is [jkPassword.com](http://jkpassword.com), which does a good job of looking native. No good if you're offline, though. (Found via [this thread](http://www.macworld.com/forums/ubbthreads/showflat.php?Cat=0&Number=509703&an=&page=&vc=1))

Instant messenger apps are also a work in progress.
