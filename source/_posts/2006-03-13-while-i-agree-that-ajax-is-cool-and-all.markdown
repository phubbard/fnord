[Ajax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29) is a super-trendy programming technique used to produce interactive web apps like google maps, google mail and many others. (Basecame, tadalist, etc).

It's cool. 

Like all cool new techniques, it's sold as the ultimate answer to life and everything, which is why [this quote](http://rentzsch.com/notes/tryThese) caused me to laugh:
