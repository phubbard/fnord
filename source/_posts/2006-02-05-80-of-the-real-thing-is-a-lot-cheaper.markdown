As noted [a previous post](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/?p=33), there are some new watches out there styled to look like classic flight instruments. For example, this Bell and Ross:

(Link is to the review where I got the picture)

That's a nice, if flashy, watch. Costs, erp, $3827USD. Then there's this:

That one costs $450USD. With a nice ETA 2824-2 movement!

I can't afford either, but it's nice to see B&R; get some price competition. I like the style, but 4k for a basic movement? No way.
