Sorry, couldn't resist the combination of [Rove-departing news](http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/08/13/rove.analysis/index.html) and classic [Edward Gibbon.](http://www.amazon.com/Decline-Fall-Roman-Empire/dp/0753818817/ref=pd_bbs_2/104-2260574-8214310?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1187144313&sr=8-2) This is neither.

David Walker, comptroller general of the US, issued the unusually downbeat assessment of his country’s future in a report that lays out what he called “chilling long-term simulations”.

These include “dramatic” tax rises, slashed government services and the large-scale dumping by foreign governments of holdings of US debt.

Drawing parallels with the end of the Roman empire, Mr Walker warned there were “striking similarities” between America’s current situation and the factors that brought down Rome, including “declining moral values and political civility at home, an over-confident and over-extended military in foreign lands and fiscal irresponsibility by the central government”.




Needless to say, it's a bit unusual for the head of the GAO to compare the USA to the Roman Empire. On his own volition, too:

While most of its studies are commissioned by legislators, about 10 per cent – such as the one containing his latest warnings – are initiated by the comptroller general himself.
