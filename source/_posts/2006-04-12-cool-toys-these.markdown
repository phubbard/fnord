A very cool visit for a simulated blast test, where they use fast servohydraulics to simulate explosives. This is to test a coating on a cinderblock wall, to see if it acts like the polymer in [safety glass.](http://computer.howstuffworks.com/question508.htm)

Pictures _and_ a video of the test itself, taken with my Canon. Enjoy!
