I was in San Francisco for [AGU 2007](http://www.agu.org/meetings/fm07/), and walked by a [Tourneau store on Market](http://www.tourneau.com/Tourneau/Main/Content/store%20locations/San%20Francisco.aspx) every day:

In the window, they had a Glashutte Original Sport Evolution Panorama Date:

Here's a PR shot:

It's quite nice, German made with in-house movement, gold rotor, lots of hand finishing, all the details of a luxury watch. List price is about $8800, typically discounted to 6500 or so, available [used on TZ](http://forums.timezone.com/index.php?t=threadt&frm_id=32) for around 4500.

I was curious to see what that much cash would get in a sport watch, and GO is widely admired for its main line of dress watches, so mid-week I venture in and ask to see it. I'm dressed reasonably well, in a pressed dress shirt, slacks and dressy boots, wearing [my Marinemaster](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2006/12/26/the-seiko-marinemaster-page/) on its bracelet. Since the Marinemaster is a rare watch in the US, I didn't expect the droid to recognize it and he surely didn't. I've read of store clerks who did admire a Marinemaster, but the 20-something I got certainly didn't.

So, he tells me that "I can't possibly compare Japanese engineering to German" and generally treats me rather shabbily. The engineering comment is absurd on its face, and was compounded by the irony of him being of obvious Asian descent.

My thought/question is this: Was this just a rude clerk, or is it a viable sales strategy to put customers on the defensive? Perhaps "If we insult what they're wearing, they'll a) see us as experts and b) spend more to buy a watch we 'respect'?"

(I was disappointed in the watch, GO doesn't do sport very well. Nicely made, but 60-click bezel and uncoated sapphire crystal. If you have the dosh for this sort of toy, you shouldn't have to accept that sort of thing.)

I've read of Saville Row tailors who do similar things, as in telling the customer "I think we can do better than _that_" with a sniff.  I've loaned out my copy of [Cialdini's "Persuasion"](http://www.amazon.com/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Business-Essentials/dp/006124189X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_5?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1198262037&sr=8-5) but I seem to recall it discussed this. As with cars, I hope that its an artifact of asymmetric information to be vanquished by the Internet. It sucks to be treated shabbily, especially as an enthusiast.

**Update 12/28/07**: I hear from a comment and an email that this seems to be the MO for Tourneau and similar stores. Exceedingly weak if true. Consider [Higuchi](http://www.higuchi-inc.com/index-e.html) or [KSeiya](http://kseiya.zoovy.com/) for Japanese, [TimeZone](http://forums.timezone.com/index.php?t=threadt&frm_id=32) for used, anything but this. It's your money, and we all deserve better.
