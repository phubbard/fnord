I just got a new [iPod video](http://www.apple.com/ipod/ipod.html) (30GB, black, verra nice) by convincing [Daniel](http://hfriend.com/) to buy my previous-gen unit.

Anyway, it was a moral imperative to figure out video encoding and not spend money. Still not sure how useful video really is, but its certainly entertaining and more legible than expected.

To rip DVDs to iPod, go get [HandBrake Lite](http://www.isquint.org/handbrakelite/), which is a hack of [HandBrake](http://handbrake.m0k.org/) made special-purpose for iPod. You can get the same results by tweaking HandBrake; the lite version is just simpler.

For videos that you have now, go try [iSquint](http://www.isquint.org/), which is Applescript wrapped around [ffmpeg.](http://ffmpeg.sourceforge.net/) Drag and drop conversion, for iPod and TV. Very simple to use, produces good results.

As an aside, one of the videos I had about was the 19-minute ["The Final Cut"](http://www.pinkfloyd.co.uk/theFinalCut/index.html)EP. Free, amazing, disturbing. [The Internet Archive](http://www.archive.org/details/movies) is another good source for free video.
