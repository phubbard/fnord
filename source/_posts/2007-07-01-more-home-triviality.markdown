Yep, we finally gave up and [posted the waterbed on Craigslist.](http://sandiego.craigslist.org/fur/363969642.html) New one is an [Ikea base](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/80121338) and [natural latex mattress.](http://www.davisworld.com/ItemDisplay.asp?strRowID=349) The combo seems to work pretty well, though we need a mattress pad as the moisture barrier makes for heat buildup. Sleeps pretty well, minimal wasted space, the drawers are a win, overall I like it.

Damn but mattresses are pricy, though. I like the place we got ours, but the sticker shock was quite something.
