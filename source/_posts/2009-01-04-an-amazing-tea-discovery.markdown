For Chris's birthday, Heidi sent her a box of a tea we'd not tried before, "Marco Polo" by the French company Mariage Freres. (Mariage Brothers). It's packed in muslin teabags, another new-to-us method, and is absolutely amazingly good. Floral, fragrant, smooth and delicious. Even when you re-use the bag a second time.

Highly recommended![![](http://fnord.phfactor.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/tb636.jpg)](http://fnord.phfactor.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/tb636.jpg)

Info and links:



	
  1. It's hard to find, so here's [the company product page for Marco Polo](http://www.mariagefreres.com/WD120AWP/WD120Awp.exe/CONNECT/mfi_boutique12?lg=en), in English.

	
  2. [Market Hall Foods](http://markethallfoods.com/store/index.php?main_page=product_mh_info&products_id=272) carries it as well.

	
  3. Here's [a nice background piece](http://www.teamuse.com/article_001201.html) on the company and their Parisian storefront. Sounds lovely.
