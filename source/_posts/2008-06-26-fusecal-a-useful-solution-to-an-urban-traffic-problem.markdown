[![](http://fnord.phfactor.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/fusecal-alpha.gif)](http://www.fusecal.com/) One of the minuses of urban life is traffic. It can be hellish, even though the locally-absurd gas prices have reduced traffic a bit. In particular, I am of the opinion that few things are ruder, stupider and more dangerous than a sports fan on their way to a game. Except maybe that same fan returning home after a few beers and a big loss. Locally, any time there's a [Padres game downtown](http://sandiego.padres.mlb.com/schedule/index.jsp?c_id=sd), the traffic backs up highways 163, 805 and 5 for **miles**. The [Chargers](http://www.chargers.com/schedule/) aren't quite as bad, since Qualcomm Stadium is east a bit, but still a problem, as are things like [Fleet Week](http://www.fleetweeksandiego.org/events.html).

For whatever reason, web-based traffic feeds don't have any concept of 'monstrous event with traffic implications,' though I really wish they'd get a clue. Maybe add a sidebar?

Initially, I had the idea to simply subscribe to their respective iCalendar feeds, and be warned that way, but that's pretty noisy; all you really care about are home games, but there aren't separate calendars for that.

Recently I found a solution that seems to work quite well called [FuseCal](http://www.fusecal.com/). It can read all sorts of feeds, including graphical calendars (impressive, that) and allows you to filter them via strings. So I have three feeds right now merging into a tag of 'traffic factors'



	
  1. [Padres](http://sandiego.padres.mlb.com/schedule/index.jsp?c_id=sd) + "at San Diego"

	
  2. [Chargers](http://www.chargers.com/schedule/) + "Qualcomm Stadium"

	
  3. [Fleet Week](http://www.fleetweeksandiego.org/events.html) (all)


If you have any suggestions as to other events to add, leave a comment, also if you want I can make the feed public. So far I'm pretty happy - this is a free service, it works very well and the merge of feeds produces information that's hard to get otherwise. Very cool.
