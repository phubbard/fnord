It's about time to replace the hard drive in [the server](http://fnord.phfactor.net/2009/09/21/fnord-through-the-years-a-nerd-saga/), the previous one is now over two years old; with server usage that's about what I expect to get before it dies.

Which kinda sucks, but there you are. New drives are cheap, and out of curiousity I grabbed [prices from Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=sr_nr_scat_1292109011_ln?rh=n%3A1292109011%2Ck%3A2.5+sata+hard+drive&keywords=2.5+sata+hard+drive&ie=UTF8&qid=1302137122&scn=1292109011&h=64266f808d09c7e51e9d2687eabd915b7139d4f8#/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=node%3D1292109011&field-keywords=2.5+sata+hard+drive&rh=n%3A172282%2Cn%3A%21493964%2Cn%3A541966%2Cn%3A1292108011%2Cn%3A1292109011%2Ck%3A2.5+sata+hard+drive) and did some plotting with [Kaleidagraph](http://www.synergy.com/):

Oddly it's pretty close to linear (R=0.93). I expected to pay more for the higher-capacity drives, especially in the 2.5" size. Here's what happens if you plot price versus dollars/GB:

There's noise in the data, and I didn't separate out for variables like RPM, cache size and such. Even with those caveats, it's pretty amazing how _cheap_ laptop drives are now. Here as soon as I have time, I'll upgrade fnord to the 750GB I bought. More space than needed, but excess capacity worries me not. Hopefully next time SSDs will be affordable.
