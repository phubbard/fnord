FlightAware is a free site for flight tracking, also seems to have nice airport traffic views (above pic is a snapshot of [San Diego airport](http://flightaware.com/live/airport/KSAN) as of right now) and traffic-over-time views:

If you enter a flight number into google, e.g. [SWA 264](http://www.google.com/search?num=20&hl=en&safe=off&q=SWA+264&btnG=Search), it'll return flight tracking, usually via FBOWeb. I think I like flightaware better, but hey! See what you think.
