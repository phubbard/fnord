I discovered [Basic Instructions](http://www.basicinstructions.net/) recently, from [the Dilbert blog](http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/). BI is good. I like it. More favorites, though you'll have to click through to see them:



	
  * [How to make a decision](http://www.basicinstructions.net/images/04decision.gif) (always good to know when to shiv your bunkmate!)

	
  * [How to fake a smile](http://www.basicinstructions.net/images/37smile.gif) (the lower-left frame really looks like Diego in [this picture](http://www.phfactor.net/pics/moving-2005/IMG_5198_Sm.jpg.74.html), doesn't it?)

	
  * [How to write a self-evaluation](http://www.basicinstructions.net/images/63eval.gif) (Think I already sent that to Terri)

	
  * [How to display your baby](http://www.basicinstructions.net/images/57dspbby.gif) (Timely, this one)

	
  * [How to face life as a morning person](http://www.basicinstructions.net/images/102morn.gif). (You know who you are.)


There's also [XKCD](http://xkcd.com/), "A webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math and language." S/he is great at puns and wordplay, too:

There's a lot more where that came from. The comic on [Lisp and Star Wars](http://xkcd.com/297/) is a must-read.

Enjoy!
