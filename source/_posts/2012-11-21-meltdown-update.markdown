So it's on the Google app store, now called Play:

![Badge](http://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_app_rgb_wo_60.png)

(I can't figure out how to make the badge a clickable link in Markdown, so [click here](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.phfactor.meltdown") if you want to see it in Google Play.)

And as of today, it's [now available on Amazon too.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A1CUBCY)

Still working on bug fixes, and planning on doing either SSL or Fragment-based layouts for tablets next.
