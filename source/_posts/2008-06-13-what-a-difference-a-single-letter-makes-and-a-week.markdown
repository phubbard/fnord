Yesterday was San Jose, CA:

Exactly one week before that was San Jose, CR:

...quite the difference, eh? One letter difference in the airport codes, too - SJC vs SJO. Anyway, the coincidence amused me, but thanks to good luck on Southwest my case of Traveller's Butt isn't too bad. Check out this luck:

If you're me on an airplane, that is absolutely the luckiest you can get. Seat 10E (I think) on the 737-xxx has a space in front of it, for over 1m of legroom! Bliss. Doubly lucky since I had gate pass B30something.

Back home now, just ran out to Santa Margarita Ecological Reserve for a meeting this morning:

So I've been quite the travellin' fool of late. Home sounds good for a while.
