I'm only doing this because [Simona tagged me](http://moosino.wordpress.com/2006/12/23/catene/). 

Sentences six to eight on page 123 of [the nearest book](http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Watch-Repairing-Donald-Carle/dp/0719800307/sr=8-2/qid=1167004139/ref=pd_bbs_2/002-0637292-9004847?ie=UTF8&s=books) are:



> 
It is quite well to mention here that the screws on the balance from the quarter screws, or the position of the quarter screws if there are none actually fitted, to the free end, are the effectual temperature screws. Positions from the quarter screws to the fixed end have little effect on the balance in temperature. In fact, there is a point, somewhere near the balance arm, that remains stationary in temperature.




Good book, dense prose, long sentences.

OK, who can I tag...
