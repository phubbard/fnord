Quick notes and impressions:



	
  1. I wish that the [1.1.1 firmware](http://www.engadget.com/2007/09/28/iphone-update-facts-and-fiction/) didn't break user code; the home button function would be handy. With hacked firmware, navigation is a bit indirect at times.

	
  2. Videos/movies are just a bit small, noticeably smaller than the [PSP](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/?cat=30). Unexpected, that. Especially widescreen content with black bars. Usable, but not ideal.

	
  3. Battery life is excellent for a smartphone, from my point of view anything over a full day is a bonus. (Though Apollo IM seems to burn a lot of battery in v1.0.) On the minus side, charging is very slow, literally _hours_. By comparison, my [N80](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2007/02/07/nokia-n80-review-and-notes/) would charge in less than 20 minutes. USB current limit? Whatever the reason, fix it!

	
  4. Pictures are good, they blog easily. (See [this example](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2007/09/26/lunch-at-bacione/)) Not fabulous, not a camera replacement, but good enough.

	
  5. Phone functions very well, especially with the headphone/microphone. Clear, comfortable, sounds great on both ends. Receiver sensitivity is better than my [Blackberry](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/?cat=2) 7290 and neck-and-neck with my Sony-Ericsson T637. Update: Chris says that clarity on the other end varies more than the other phones, andis sometimes awful.

	
  6. The headphones are a mixed blessing. I adore the microphone/button, but

	
    1. Because of the recessed jack I can't use my Etymotics

	
    2. The available adapter to fix this is a stupid design and will break the phone

	
    3. Third-party headphones don't have microphones yet

	
    4. Apple earbuds slip out of my ears in a matter of seconds, which results in the nerdly dance of Continually Adjusting the Earbuds like a Fool.




	
  7. Been trying [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/) for RSS, great on the desktop and still getting used to it on Mobile Safari.

	
  8. Email works well, but

	
    1. I wanna be able to delete >1 at once

	
    2. More than one active mailbox requires jumping back and forth - worthless!




	
  9. iPod works great. The fade in/out on phone calls is worth the entire price of admission. I used to miss Chris calling me while on the bus, but now she's right there. Sweet.

	
  10. I have no need of ringtones, so no opinions on that mess.


Overall? Strong recommend. Superb device, easiest smartphone to use I've seen. As with Apple at their finest, it scales from geek to non-techie alike.
