[Fascism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism) is usually used as a debate-ending insult in American politics, along with any comparison to Hitler. From the [Farber IP list](http://www.interesting-people.org/) comes this interesting tidbit:



> 
Lawrence W. Briit, who have studied the regimes of Nazi Germany,
Fascist Italy, Franco's Spain, Salazar's Portugal, Papadopoulos's
Greece, Pinochet's Chile, and Suharto's Indonesia to get some unifying
characteristics of fascism. He has distilled it to 14 common
behaviours. They are:

1. Powerful and continuing expressions of nationalism.
2. Disdain for the importance of human rights.
3. Identification of enemies/scapegoats as a unifying cause.
4. The supremacy of the military/avid militarism.
5. Rampant sexism.
6. A controlled mass media.
7. Obsession with national security.
8. Religion and ruling elite tied together.
9. Power of corporations protected.
10. Power of labor suppressed or eliminated.
11. Disdain and suppression of intellectuals and the arts.
12. Obsession with crime and punishment.
13. Rampant cronyism and corruption.
14. Fraudulent elections.

For more detail on Mr Britt's analysis of each of the points, see
[http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/fi/britt_23_2.htm](http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/fi/britt_23_2.htm). At least
Keith Olberman proves that point 6 is not valid in the US. At least
not yet.




As Pinochet finally bit the dust, it seemed a good time to post this. Any resemblence to current events elsewhere is, well, not good.
