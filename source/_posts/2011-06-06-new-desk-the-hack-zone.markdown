My new job started today. Very unusually, it's 100% telecommute, so as part of getting ready I needed to make a home working space. I'm always curious as to how other people hack, so I figured it'd be worth sharing.

Here's a bad picture of the previous arrangement - imac on the desk, photometer and a shitload of bills, healthcare and other paper stacked on it, laptop kinda sitting wherever there's space:

Step one - move the iMac off:

This leaves rather a mess:

Clean 'er up:

Next, borrow a strong and patient friend and hump the damn thing up a very tight stairwell. We had to do this twice, and neither time was easy **or** fun.

(This was the first try. We had to restart, move the bookcase and start topside-up to make the turn at the landing.)

Next, dig the trusty (circa 2008!) Dell 30" LCD out of the garage and cough up for a [less-buggy dual-link DVI adapter](http://fnord.phfactor.net/2009/02/22/displayport-dual-link-dvi-glitch/):

Look at, decide you Need More Pixels, and pull the old 19" LCD out of its box as well, connected up via [the DisplayLink](http://fnord.phfactor.net/2010/06/04/lots-and-lots-and-lots-of-pixels-on-a-macbook/):

Nice, clean, uncluttered and focused! **5,240 horizontal pixels**!!!

Gotta figure out how to match heights and such, but already it's a great place to hack.

And, as you can see, I finally have a corner window office!

The rest of the room will come as I have time.
