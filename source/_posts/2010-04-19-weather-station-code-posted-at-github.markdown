I've been meaning to post the Arduino and Python code for [the weather station](http://fnord.phfactor.net/2009/06/23/arduino-datalogger-is-up/) for some time now, so today when [our group](http://ooici.net/) decided to migrate code hosting to [github](http://github.com/), I figured I'd use my project as a test case to explore github.

Anyway, it was a total toddle. Github is astoundingly well polished: Little details, like a customized how-to page for a new project, really help, as do the wiki and automatic inclusion of the README as a front page.
