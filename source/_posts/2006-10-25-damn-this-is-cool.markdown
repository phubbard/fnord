![LED-lit Nalgene bottle](http://www.guyotdesigns.com/site/img/firefly/fireflypage.gif)](http://www.guyotdesigns.com/s.nl/it.A/id.303/.f?sc=10&category=-110)


If you do much outdoors, you've probably encountered the Cult of the [Nalgene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nalgene) by now. Their polycarbonate [(Lexan)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexan) bottles are an article of faith, able to handle boiling water, non-odor-absorbing, cheap, and incredibly tough. I still have one from more years ago than I care to remember.

Anyway. Where was I? Oh yeah, senile.

So Nalgene is cool. What else is cool? Nerd cool?

Yep, LED lights. Combine the two, and damn! I **want** one. Variable brightness, from dim to reading light, and it diffuses through the water instead of adding a lens.

If you're going hiking, this is a total no-brainer. If they cost less ($22), I'd have ordered a couple already. I'm only hesitating because it's poor form to self-gift less than two weeks from [SWMBO's](http://www.woodbutcher.net/swmbo.htm) birthday, but I'm sure as hell adding it to [the gift registry.](http://phpgiftreg.sourceforge.net/)
