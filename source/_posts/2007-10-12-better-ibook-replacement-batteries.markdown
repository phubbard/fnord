(This one is for [Larry](http://users.sdsc.edu/~ljmiller/) and [Martin](http://www.cis.udel.edu/~swany/).)

Chris's iBook battery had started to age out, and it was time to replace it. The [stock Apple battery](http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/wa/RSLID?mco=7E4F2D7D&nplm=M9338G/A) is 61 watt-hours, for $129.  This yields ~6 hours of runtime when new.

However, from my time with [Nestor](http://www.msd.anl.gov/groups/emc/personnel/zaluzec/index.html) at Argonne, I knew of a company called [Newer Tech](http://www.newertech.com/). (Pun intended.) They make a line of high-quality batteries with higher capacities than the stock Apple parts, and the prices tend to match Apple's.  So here's their offering:

Looks the same, but 74 watt-hours for the same price. Kind of a no-brainer, eh? They also have a 60W-H, but for the difference in price its better to get the 74 IMHO. The new unit is producing ridiculously long runtimes on the iBook, much to my 3-hours-on-a-good-day-MBP envy.

What's more, they include free recycling of your old battery, with prepaid shipping. I really like that.

Highly recommended.
