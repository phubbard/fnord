I read the [Joel on Software](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/) RSS feed for its occasional tidbits, and yesterday brought a lovely one. He wrote [a column for Inc magazine](http://www.inc.com/magazine/20081101/how-hard-could-it-be-the-unproven-path.html?partner=fogcreek), where he espoused the virtues of his latest effort, a website called Stack Overflow. So far so good, and I'm always happy to see new programmer resources online.

The [irony](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony) emerges in his boasts of the sites' stability and scalability:


> We're not going to need big racks of computers; it turns out that Jeff and his programmers were so good that they built a site that could serve 80,000 visitors a day (roughly 755,000 page views) using only one server that costs a few hundred bucks a month.


I should also note that 'stack overflow' (Wikipedia [has a nice page on it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_overflow)) is a bug/error that causes unpredictable failures.

So this morning I go to look and get this:

Yep, site down. Without the boasting it would have just been growing pains, but with the boasting it transcends into [hubris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubris) and [irony](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony). Oops.
