Yesterday set a high-water mark of sorts. I'm not sure whether to include the barfing, since it ended around 3AM, but between that, the emergency root canal, and the hot water heater's catastrophic failure, it was _quite_ a day.

(The better half was also ill; we rather suspect the meat from the local supermarket. Well cooked, and we're careful about cleanliness, so who knows.)

Oh yeah, I had to get up at 6AM, so I had about 3 solid hours of sleep. Whine whinge whine.
