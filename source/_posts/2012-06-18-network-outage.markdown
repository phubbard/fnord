I'm writing this post with the site offline, using my fallback Android phone in hotspot mode. Early this morning, our area of San Diego had a 5-hour power outage, and when we awoke U-Verse was down.

Oddly, SDGE doesn't list our outage on their site, but by the simple metric of an auto-resuming electronic clock its easy to quantify.

Most annoying, since I have a stack of Eclipse updates and such to download. Hopefully I won't blow through my byte quota on the Android.

On the annoying side, I was trying to use my spare Airport Extreme to bridge from WiFi to Ethernet, so that some of my wired-only devices could get online, and I couldn't get it to work. The Airport could connect fine, get an IP and such via DHCP, but it then claimed to have failed! Damn it, that's *so close* to working. Would have made a great fallback connection, at least for the non-server devices.

So yeah, it's Monday here, and then some.
