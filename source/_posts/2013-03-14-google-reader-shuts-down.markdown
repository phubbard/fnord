The net is [raging with reactions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25VgNZDQ08), but I have to indulge in a bit of [I told you so](https://fnord.phfactor.net/2012/02/24/migrating-away-from-google/) here. 

Anyway, do as I did and [buy yourself a copy of Fever](http://feedafever.com). And install [my Meltdown app](https://github.com/phubbard/meltdown) or, on iOS, [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/iphone/). 

You'll be happier. Fever is solid, and I like running it on my own server. (EC2 micro instances work well too.)

For a while I paid for and used [NewsBlur](http://newsblur.com) but the iOS app was too unreliable for me. By now it should be fine.
