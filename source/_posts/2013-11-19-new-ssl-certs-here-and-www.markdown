My one-year certs were expiring, as expected GoDaddy jacks the price up for renewals. The original cost was $7 per cert for a year, upon renewal they are $69. Each.

Umm, hell no.

A quick search later I found [this roundup of providers](http://webdesign.about.com/od/ssl/tp/cheapest-ssl-certificates.htm) and off to [Namecheap.com](https://www.namecheap.com/ssl-certificates/comodo.aspx) I went.

They have a nice website, I chose 2-year Comodo 'Positive SSL' certs ($7.95 each) for here and www.phfactor.net. Total cost $35.80, and the signup and install process was painless. And hey! Now I have two years before I have this to redo.

Recommended.
