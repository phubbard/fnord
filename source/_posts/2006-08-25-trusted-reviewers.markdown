One of the things I most value on the net is unbiased (hey, I can dream) reviews of stuff I may need or want. To my mind, being able to find sources not paid to review stuff, cater to advertisers, etc is the best thing ever.

So. Here's a partial list of my favorites, with notes. Please feel free to comment, I'll add 'em in.



#### Cars/vehicles


[Edmunds, easily the best.](http://edmunds.com/) [Click and clack](http://cartalk.com/menus/info.html) are arguably better, but have much fewer reviews. We have used their [mechanic recommendations](http://www.cartalk.com/content/mechx/) with good results. For resale values, Edmunds again and [Kelly blue book.](http://www.kbb.com/)



#### iPods, iPod cases, headphones, accessories


[iPodlounge.](http://ilounge.com/) Their reviews are excellent, as is their free PDF book of all things iPod. For really geeky reviews, [Dan's Data](http://dansdata.com/) is my all-around favorite internet review site. It's mostly computers, but he also does headphones now and then. [Headphone.com](http://headphone.com/) has good specs and reviews, but their prices are high - try Amazon or ebay or your retailer of choice.



#### Computer hardware


This is a big one. These days, I mostly just buy a few parts now and then, or maybe a cheap motherboard/cpu/memory combo, for which the [Ars Technica system guides](http://arstechnica.com/guides/buyer/system-guide-200608.ars) are invaluable. Ars doesn't do a lot of hardware reviews, but what they publish is in-depth and worth reading. They review Mac hard/software too.
As mentioned above, [Dan's Data](http://dansdata.com/) is essential here too. 



#### Cameras, digital of course


[DP Review](http://www.dpreview.com/), [Imaging Resource](http://www.imaging-resource.com/) and [Philip Greenspun's reviews](http://philip.greenspun.com/photography/). Also check out [photo.net](http://photo.net/)



#### Watches


Heh. You _knew_ [this one was coming](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2005/10/28/retrocomputing-and-mechanical-watches/), eh? For basic reviews and learning about new watches, [Watch Report](http://www.watchreport.com/) is good. For forums with good reviews, try [Seiko-Citizen watch forum](http://www.network54.com/Forum/78440/), [Poor Man's Watch Forum](http://www.pmwf.com/cgi-bin/Forum/webbbs_config.cgi), [TimeZone](http://forums.timezone.com/index.php?t=threadt&frm_id=4&rid=0) and probably others.

I may post places to buy watches in a follow-up post if I have time.



#### Cool Random Stuff


[Cool Tools](http://www.kk.org/cooltools/index.php) defines this genre all by itself. I don't always agree, but all are interesting.

See also the randomness of [Tricks of the Trade.](http://www.tradetricks.org/)

And of course, [Woot](http://www.woot.com/), which should come with an 'addictive' label.

And [Think Geek](http://thinkgeek.com/), cool but a trifle pricy.

More on this topic later.
