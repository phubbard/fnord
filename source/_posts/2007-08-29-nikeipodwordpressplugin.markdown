As Terri noticed, there's a new sidebar on the website. I got it installed last night, but due to the downtime I haven't posted about it yet. It's a bit of a tale...

Late last week, in a historic moment, I sold my Blackberry 7290 to a co-worker. Yep, an era has passed, and life is simpler now. Then again, I may get another one, or maybe an iPhone if I stumble upon a pile of small unmarked bills.

Post-sale, I had thirty bucks burning a hole in my pocket and was at the campus bookstore.  I happened to see the [Nike+iPod kit](http://www.apple.com/ipod/nike/), and voila! Money spent, happiness purchased, a new gadget to play with. (I also spent ten bucks on a [generic sensor holder](http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/ipod/review/marware-sportsuit-sensorplus-for-nike-ipod-sport-kit/), so I don't need special shoes, but don't tell Chris that.)

The kit is an amazing thing. Check out the [review on iLounge](http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/ipod/review/apple-computer-nike-ipod-sport-kit/) for details, but the basic idea is that you have a sensor in your shoe:


![Sensor in shoe](http://www.phfactor.net/wp-pics/gearshoedrawing20060523.jpg)


which sends acceleration data to a 2x3cm sensor that attaches to your iPod nano:

Wireless, baby!

Once you get back to your computer, iTunes sends the run data to Nike's servers, where they have a bunch of Flash applications that use it. You can plot runs, compare goals vs performance, compete against others around the world, etc, etc. All very nifty, and it still amazes me that the cost is **thirty bucks!** No use fees, either, just the one-time.

While reading about it, I found the [Nike+iPod plugin for Wordpress](http://www.ear-fung.us/apps/nikeplus/). It, very cleverly, can download your data from the Nike servers and display it in Wordpress. It even uses the GD library to plot speed versus time!

A reader who knows me might well observe the spectacularly useless nature of all this effort and complexity...since I don't run. To such a reader, I would reply that this _entire weblog_ (Anna pages excepted) is a veritable _monument_ to the spectacular and the useless, all the more better if combined.

My current plan is to use it for my shuttle walks. It'll be thrilling data, you can be sure. I still need to calibrate the sensor for my stride length, so the current data is erroneous by an unknown amount. I would guess that the distances are too short, given that I have a longer stride than average. We shall see.

I am really tempted to send a couple of these out as gifts to the walkers in the family. Competitions would ensue, friendly ribbings and other such fun. Hmm... some of 'em even have Nanos already...

For more info, check out [the iLounge review](http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/ipod/review/apple-computer-nike-ipod-sport-kit/). You can get the kit everywhere; I've even seen it at Nordstrom's in the mall.
