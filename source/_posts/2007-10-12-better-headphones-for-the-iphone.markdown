As [previously griped about](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2007/09/27/more-iphone-impressions-after-a-couple-weeks/), the iPhone earbuds kinda suck. They don't stay in place and are nearly useless on the noisy bus I ride. I can't use my etymotics, either, due to the stoopid iPhone headphone jack being recessed. Even if I buy [the adapter](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2007/09/28/a-couple-quick-iphone-tips/), I lose the microphone/switch that makes the whole thing work.

Man, I am one spoiled nerd, aren't I?

Anyway, much googling later I have a potential solution, the [v-moda Vibe Duo](https://shop.v-moda.com/p-35-vibe-duo-w-control-playback.aspx):

These are pretty new, basically a modified pair of their semi-sealed Vibe earphones with a microphone and switch added, $101 from their store. Be careful, though, as there is also an older version that has the mic but lacks the switch! Even worse, that's what [the Apple store is selling](http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/wa/RSLID?mco=CB59290A&fnode=home/shop_iphone/iphone_accessories&nplm=TN543LL/A), and you don't want it. You want part number VDB-NERO.

The old version [gets a B+ from iLounge](http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/ipod/review/v-moda-vibe-duo-earphones-with-microphone/), and they're pretty picky. I had considered the predecessor for my iPod before Chris bought me the Etymotics, so from my reading I think the audio quality is decent. Not studio monitors, but OK.

As an alternative, there's the [Shure iPhone adapter](http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/wa/RSLID?mco=848A8F44&fnode=home/shop_iphone/iphone_accessories&nplm=TN544LL/A) with microphone for $40:

 My problem with that is the total length; adding a mic in the middle of the cable is kind of a lose.

Leave me a comment if you've tried either!
