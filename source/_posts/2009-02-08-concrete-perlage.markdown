Decent grade watches often have an overlapping circular decoration on the plates and bridges. Originally devised to catch dust, it's now machine-applied for the most part and quite decorative. Here's a picture from my C5 Malvern:

It's called perlage, or more correctly [_L'oeil de perdrix_ (F.) literally translates in English as "partridge eye."](http://montresuisses.blogspot.com/2007/10/terms-of-art-oeil-de-perdrix.html)

Apparently, it has other applications too:

Yep, same pattern, applied to concrete in the parking garage. I'd guess it's more for traction here.

There's beauty everywhere.
