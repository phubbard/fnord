I've written before about [sugar](http://fnord.phfactor.net/2007/02/25/sugar-the-opiate-of-our-times/) and [obesity](http://fnord.phfactor.net/2007/07/19/interesting-paper-one-cause-of-obesity-found/), but today I found a [whopper of an article](http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2008/10/31/fructose_in_the_brain.php) on [previously-linked](http://fnord.phfactor.net/2008/03/05/laugh-out-loud-chemistry-humor/) "In the Pipeline". Get this:



> 
The large amount of high-fructose corn syrup produced and used in the US and other industrialized countries makes this an issue with very large political, economic, and public health implications.
...
It's going to take a while to make sure, but if things continue along this path, there could be reasons for a large change in the industrialized human diet. 




He links to [a paper on fructose vs glucose](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2008/10/28/0809255105.full.pdf) and the takeaway seems to be that fructose makes you feel less full, not more. The opposite effect from glucose.



Read the complete post for a much more detailed analysis, but the use of [HFCS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HFCS) will, I hope, come under a great deal more scrutiny.
