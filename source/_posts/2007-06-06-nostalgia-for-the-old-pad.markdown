One advantage of the old house was room to hack - here's my previous configuration. You can see the server, switches, my desktop PC, network printer, tools, power, audio gear, parts, a whiteboard and my electronics bench on the right. Now, I have one of the racks, and all else is in the garage.

Not visible are the **rest** of the room, equally large, with my telecommute desk, window and bookcases.

Sniff.

Ahh well, the weather _is_ better here, even if real estate is, well, unreal.
