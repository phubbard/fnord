I was up at SDSC today, and saw this out the window:
[![cables](http://fnord.phfactor.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/cables-450x600.jpg)](http://fnord.phfactor.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/cables.jpg)

SDSC is clearing out the old machine room, and had stacks and stacks and stacks of cabling they've removed. Newer hardware generally equals fewer and thinner cables; nice, that.
