It's the [model number of the first IBM PC, 25 years ago today](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4780963.stm), it's the [model number of the Xeon chips in the new mid-grade MacPro](http://arstechnica.com/reviews/hardware/macpro.ars), it's [a rap group](http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:0n6dtrowkl3x), and of course [a Van Halen album](http://www.van-halen.com/newsite/5150.html).

There's even more [numerologic trivia waiting for you on Wikipedia.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5150)
