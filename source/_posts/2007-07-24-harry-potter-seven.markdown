Having just finished the last book, I have to [agree with Moosino.](http://moosino.wordpress.com/2007/07/23/deathly-hallows/) It's pretty damned good. 

I was thinking about this after reading [this post on RMP.](http://www.robotmonkeypants.com/2007/07/23/harry-potter-and-the-annoying-fanbase/) I have to disagree with Craig on this one. He says that

However, I’m proud to say that I’m blissfully ignorant about Harry Potter. I’ve never read one of the books, and I’ve never seen one of the movies.

Why is that?

Because it’s a children’s book series, and (this is the important part here, pay close attention) I’m not a child.




Personally, some of the other authors I like (e.g. [LM Bujold](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/002-8622545-7884847?%5Fencoding=UTF8&search-type=ss&index=books&field-author=Lois%20Mcmaster%20Bujold)) are filed in children's or 'young adult' and it doesn't bother me. In the case of Rowling, she's a good storyteller and the plots have developed nicely across the series. I enjoyed reading them and they even re-read well. 

It's a lot lighter weight than 'real literature', but then again we all bottom feed sometimes.

I do have one gripe though - if Harry's cloak is part of the Hallows, how come Mad-Eye could see through it in the earlier books?

Read what you like, and ignore the labels!
