[MacFusion.](http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/08/mgorbach/MacFusionWeb/index.html)

A sweet little menubar applet front end for [MacFuse](http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/), which is a port of the Linux-original user-mounted filesystems.

Non-geek translation: You can use this to mount remote Unix or OSX machines as Mac filesystems. It's easy. It handles sleep/wake, and seems more stable than the sshfs command line. 

Trying it now for having my itunes library on my server, will see how it works.

Update: Ghort comments that this fails for him due to mismatched UID/GIDs. I didn't notice because, due to similar problems with NFS, I set my server UID to match my laptop UID some months ago. Not sure if there's a workaround or not, there probably is but MacFusion may not accommodate it easily.
