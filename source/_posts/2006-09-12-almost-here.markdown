![C Ward aviator](http://www.phfactor.net/pics/watches/aviator7-scaled.jpg)](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2006/09/02/aviator-eta-2824-2-elabore-grade-as-cased-by-christopher-ward/) Got home at five to six to find that the post office had tried to deliver it today. On the one hand, I am delighted as I've resembled a dog waiting for its owner to return. On the other hand, I hafta wait, 'cause they closed at six. Damn!

Guess I'll be getting up early.
