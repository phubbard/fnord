This one falls under "scratching one's own itches" and "build it for yourself," but how about a website where you enter





  1. Your address or approximate location

  2. Your current internet connection speed

  3. Your current internet provider

  4. Your current monthly bill


That sets the current state. You then enter


* Desired speeds

* Desired prices

* Other constraints like fixed IP, port blocking, throttling, etc.

and the site would notify you when a better connectivity option matching your criteria became available. For example, Verizon FIOS, or even something like 4G LTE via a MiFi.

Personally, I'd love this. "Ping me when U-verse introduces a faster connection," or "some new startup is offering fiber in your area." 

Not at all impossible technically, the hard part would be getting data from the ISPs but since there's not that many of those it'd be do-able. 

I've no spare time, but someone _please_ implement this and make a mint!
