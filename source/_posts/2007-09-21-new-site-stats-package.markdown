It's surprisingly hard to tell how many visitors a site has. Blog spam (as of today, Akismet has caught over 100k on this insignificant site alone, amazing!), search engine bots, various badly-coded web crawlers, hacked windows boxes trying canned breakin scripts, etc, etc... you get the idea. There's so much noise in the logs that you just can't tell.

I've tried a couple of programs that parse the server logs ([Analog](http://www.analog.cx/) and  [Webalizer](http://www.mrunix.net/webalizer/)), as well as modify-the-PHP-to-call-Javascript solutions like [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) and [BDP Referral Tracker](http://www.ozpolitics.info/blog/?p=32). None of 'em really got the job done well.

So today I've spent $30 of my [WatchReport](http://watchreport.com/) funds on  [Mint](http://www.haveamint.com/). It gets a [great review from John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/colophon), [demo](http://www.haveamint.com/about/demo) looks great (there's even a CSS file for [viewing stats on my iPhone](http://www.haveamint.com/peppermill/pepper/57/iphone/), bonus!) and the price is right. It's added to the header for WordPress, so we'll see how it goes.

You shouldn't see any difference at all, though it should be faster because, unlike Analytics, it's all hosted locally and doesn't need to go offsite at any point. Nice, that.
