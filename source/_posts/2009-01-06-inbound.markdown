Purty, eh? Movement is the [Sea-Gull ST16](http://www.tractionink.com/watch_wiki/index.php?title=Tianjin_Seagull), a copy of the ETA 2824-2. Hacking, handwinding, and machine finished. To borrow a picture from [this review](http://forums.watchuseek.com/showthread.php?t=202627):

Looks similar in finish to [my last Alpha](http://fnord.phfactor.net/2008/11/01/stalking-the-usps-or-the-waiting/), but reviews are quite positive. I'm really hoping that it's of higher quality and will serve as a better replacement for [the failed G-P experiment](http://fnord.phfactor.net/2008/12/09/the-other-hong-kong-watch-vintage-girard-perragaux-gyromatic/).Â 

The dial and font really look to me like classic JLC. Here's an image borrowed from [this page](http://www.minutemachines.com/watches/JLC/Hometime.html):

This is funded from WatchReport and selling Cisco on eBay, so with a smidge of luck it won't irritate the lovely-and-talented Chris. ;) I'll post a review after I get it.

Update: $139 shipped, including a 2-year warranty.
