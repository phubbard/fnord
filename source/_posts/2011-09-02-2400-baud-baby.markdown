I was walking to the pharmacy this week and passed a sidewalk construction project. The crew had the intersection control box open, so I paused and snapped a picture:

On the upper portion, on the 4U component that's likely the CPU, there's a white sticker that says, in big red letters, "2400 baud".

(The rest appears to be modular power supplies, wish I knew why they need so many. One per corner?)

I was using 2400 baud modems more years ago than I care to compute, and I'm amused to see them still in use, for safety-critical functions. Cheap as chips, quick to connect, and well understood. Credit card readers at stores still use them for the same reason.
