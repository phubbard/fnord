Then the migration from [EveryDNS](http://www.everydns.com/) to [DynDNS](https://www.dyndns.com/) is working.

Whew. The [Register reminded me](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/06/07/free_dns_dead/) to get this done, and thankfully I [had already donated](http://fnord.phfactor.net/2008/01/09/expect-some-downtime-here-soon/) when I signed up with EveryDNS, so it just cost me $5 for the migration.

Fingers crossed, [DNS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) is always problematic. Might take a day or two for the DNS record update at [NS](https://www.networksolutions.com/) to propagate.
