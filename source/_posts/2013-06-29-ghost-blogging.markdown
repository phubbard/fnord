Forgot to mention this, but close after losing all the blog images in the server migration, I found and funded [Ghost on Kickstarter](http://tryghost.org). It looks modern and awesome, so rather than spending more time on Octopress I'll see how Ghost does. Supposed to have Jekyll/Octopress import out-of-the-box.

As a side note, I tried to find images on [archive.org](http://archive.org) but only found a measly six. Ahh well.

Really hoping that Ghost makes blogging easier, as the Rake/Octopress process is a real deterrent to casual writing.
