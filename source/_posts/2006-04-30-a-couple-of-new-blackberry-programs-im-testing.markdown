[A travel planner called GoSkip](http://www.bbhub.com/2006/04/19/blackberry-toting-road-warriors-have-new-trip-organizer-tool/) and [a free promo game called RV pileup](http://www.rimarkable.com/archives/653) from the new Robin Williams movie.

[There's also this new push weather service](http://www.blackberrycool.com/2006/04/25/001673/) but I can't get it to accept San Diego as an address, so I dunno how useful it is.
