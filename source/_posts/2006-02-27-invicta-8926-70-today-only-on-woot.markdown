This Invicta has an excellent reputation as a well-made Submariner lookalike. 65 bucks is a good price for a very nice watch.

Check out some reviews [here](http://www.geekhideout.com/invicta-9937.shtml), [here](http://www.timezone.com/library/archives/archives631667691079705901), [here (vs Seiko, nice)](http://home.woh.rr.com/johnholbrook/seikovsinvicta.html), and [here.](http://www.jirams.btinternet.co.uk/InvReview.html)

I'm on a spending hiatus, so I can't get one. Ahh well. Someday my Seiko will come.
