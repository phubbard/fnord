Just a quick recommend - the stock rubber strap on [my Marinemaster](http://fnord.phfactor.net/2006/12/26/the-seiko-marinemaster-page/) is stiff, probably polyvinyl, and not very comfortable. I've tried a couple of other silicone straps, but this one is the best so far and reasonably priced. I like polymer straps, as it lets me wear the watch in comfort and go straight from work into the lap pool without worries. This one is thick enough that even the heavy 180g watch doesn't flop around, and it's a good length on my 7.5" wrist. It probably won't fit over a wetsuit, but for normal wear its quite good.

Under thirty bucks, which is a good price for silicone. Me like. And hell, 'Strapped for Time' is a great title for their store, wordplay I have to admire.

Other things I like: Doesn't slip around, the strap 'keepers' are rubber and not steel (more comfortable when typing, which I do a lot), low-profile buckle, and looks quite unobtrusive. The seller has flashier patterns, but I liked this one. No picture **on** the Marinemaster yet, I'll try and update this post with one when I get a chance.
