Not sure what I think of this one. The change in extraction temperature would really change the flavor. I've noticed this with [the Aeropress](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2006/09/12/almost-forgot-the-aeropress/) as well, but that's closer to 140F, not 32.

I also like the Edwardian-industrial look of it, pretty cool. At 100USD, its a bit much for impulse shopping though.

UPDATE: I found this via [NOTCOT](http://www.notcot.org/post/2014?goto#2014), although they don't say much other than to praise the coffee it makes.
