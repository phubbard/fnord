So yesterday I got the Verizon iPhone. I had managed to botch the upgrade on my 3GS a few months ago, re-locking in the process, and have been unable to fix it since then. (redsn0w, ultrasn0w, pwnage tool, greenpoison, etc, etc. Not as fun as it used to be.) It's good to have a smartphone again; I've been using an el cheapo unlocked GSM from ebay.

This morning, I saw this in the settings of the new phone:

OK, WTF? I've had it less than 24 hours at this point, and have barely used cellular data at all (a bit of maps, maybe 3 minutes of netflix video.) - 2.4GB?!

I hope that this is a glitch somewhere, because if those numbers are correct then something is _seriously_ broken.

(Oh yeah - so far it's great. Network is as promised, I made a call from inside a steel elevator this morning! And the phone itself is superb, as expected.)
