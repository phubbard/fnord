If you're a nerd, this is _very_ funny. Right now, there's an effort to [standardize the format of virtual machine image files](http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=201805033), which are a super-hot item in the tech world. What file format did they choose?


> Specifically, the draft standard defines the so-called TAR file format, originally developed for tape archiving, as a standard file format for virtual machines. It also defines XML metadata formats to be included in a virtual machine to define its hardware and licensing requirements.

Yep, a [TAR file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_file) one of the oldest Unix file formats extant, dating from the early 1970's. They are also using XML for metadata, making this a nice sandwich of the old and the new.

It's also reinforcement for one of my design principles, that simple and well-documented will last a _lot_ longer than you think.
