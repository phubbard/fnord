I just upgraded the 80GB drive in Chris's iBook to a 250. Unlike my   MacBookPro upgrade, it was quite difficult. Note the five pieces of   paper with screws on them - those were the spatial maps for each   layer. Total time around 4 hours, whew.

Working very well now, but set aside an afternoon for this one. I got   instructions from [this page](http://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Mac/iBook-G4-14-Inch/84/) and [this one too.](http://www.faqintosh.com/risorse/en/guides/hw/ibook/g4hd/) Both are nice and pictorial.
