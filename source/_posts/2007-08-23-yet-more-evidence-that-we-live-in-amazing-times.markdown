From [EE Times](http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=201801958):


> 
LONDON â€” Intel Corp. (Santa Clara, Calif.) has demonstrated its 45-nm, four-core "Yorkfield" multiprocessor at the Leipzig Games Convention in Germany.

Intel said in press statement that it would start selling the Yorkfield multiprocessor later this year. The Yorkfield processor operates at 2.83-GHz and includes 12-Mbytes of level-2 cache, according to online reports.

Intel usually creates multiple part numbers from each processor die by specifying lower clock frequency versions and disabling functions such as areas of cache.




Damn. I guess all those parallel programming classes with [Bader](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~bader/) are paying off yet again. Heh.

Commodity quad-CPU 'personal computers.' Pardon me, as I simply must be old-computer-geek mode for a minute and savor this. Simply bloody _marvelous_ times to be alive and a computer geek!
