The much-anticipated new BlackBerry 'Pearl' 8100 is out, thinner than a Motorola Razr, _finally_ added a 1.3 megapixel camera, SureType (half-qwerty + software) keyboard, 2.0 Bluetooth, media player too.

List on [the T-Mobile site](http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/phones/Detail.aspx?device=6d4fca92-916c-48bd-a991-e1f1dc91bc0d&WT.mc_n=BBPearl_Tout&WT.mc_t=OnsiteAd) as $199 with rebates, damned reasonable really.

Off to call the retention rep at T-mobile to see if they'll cut me a deal!

**Update:** Nope, lame. 238 shipped, or the same basic 200 dollar deal. Hmm. I suspect this will be free soon on Amazon, with new activation. Wonder if I should drop and re-enroll?
