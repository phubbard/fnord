Yes, **all** of the inline blog images are gone. Toast. Kaput. One hundred percent operator error.

I made a mistake in copying over data from the previous server to the new one, and some of the contents of the all-important /usr/share/wordpress/wp-content directory tree didn't get copied.

Then I compounded the fault by not doing enough checking post-migration.

Then I compounded *that* by re-using the backup drive on the new system.

I am deeply embarassed by this. I know this is a low-traffic site, but this is the sort of amateur-hour error that has me [questioning my compentence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning-Kruger). 

There are 849 posts in the blog, so it's not feasible to manually try and fix each, so I may just declare Blog Bankruptcy and start over.

Sorry.
