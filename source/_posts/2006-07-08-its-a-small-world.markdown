A few years ago we spent three weeks in Brazil for a friends' wedding, mostly in Curitiba. (The picture above is their library/museum, which links to the pictures from the trip).

Today I read in Treehugger that there's a six-part BBC series on 'the disposable planet', with an extended look at Curitiba. Comparing it with a suburb of Johannesburg, actually.
