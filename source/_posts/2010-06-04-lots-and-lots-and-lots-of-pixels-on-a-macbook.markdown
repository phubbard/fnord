The problem:

At work, I plug my laptop into a 30" display. So far, so good, so spoiled. However, sitting unused in the corner is a forlorn 24" display. This cannot stand!

The solution is [$43 from Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002F9NSMQ?qid=1275606115&ref_=sr_1_6&s=electronics&sr=8-6):

Kensington display driver, with silicon by DisplayLink. Unlike the IOGear version, this one can drive widescreen and has no problem driving 1920x1200.

A quick action shot:

For those of you keeping track at home, that's **4480 pixels wide**!

So far, speed is decent, I'm going to use it mainly to display web pages and terminal windows, so performance is good enough for that. If I can find another monitor, you can have more of 'em attached to the same machine...

Supposed to also work with Windows, haven't tested that.

Recommended.
