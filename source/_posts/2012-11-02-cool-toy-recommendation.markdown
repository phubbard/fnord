So I found [this neat toy](http://www.visiblenergy.com/products/monostrip.html) via [AnandTech's review](http://www.anandtech.com/show/6413/visible-energy-ufo-power-center-smart-power-strip-review/2). Fifty bucks USD gets you a WiFi-connected smart power strip that keeps four months' worth of usage data, streams to a cloud service, has a freakin' iOS app, and includes the ability to remotely control the outlet. (I think. Need to verify that; the $129 version does for sure.)

Oh yeah, it can also send usage-based alerts and according to Anand is extremely precise and accurate in its power measurements.

AND IT'S GOT A REST API that returns JSON or XML. Your data is instantly accessible and scriptable. No vendor lock-in. Brilliant.

That's my iMac (27), a Dell 30" model 3007WFPHC LCD and a few USB accessories and my work HP laptop. Wow, that's a *lot* of power.

Interestingly, a quick test with the REST API shows the Dell burns 140W all by itself. It's roughly 2008 vintage, and it seems likely that the efficiency has improved since then, since that's more than the entire iMac is using!

Off to experiment and measure. Highly recommended, just a superb value.
