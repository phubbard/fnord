Reviews are [here (Sir Les's excellent unboxing review)](http://www.network54.com/Forum/78440/thread/1150213174/Another+opening%2C+another+show..........%28many+pics%29+%26gt%3B%26gt%3B) and [here. (full product family, with pics and comparison).](http://www.network54.com/Forum/78440/thread/1151223693/)

In my [continuing](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2005/12/03/watches-for-flying/)   [ obsession](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2006/03/13/another-thing-i-want-but-dont-need/) [ with ](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2006/05/16/omega-and-analog-digital/) [analog-digital](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2006/05/16/orient-analog-digital-review/) [ watches](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2005/12/03/breitling-and-analog-digital/), I found this one via the [very dangerous SCWF](http://www.network54.com/Forum/78440/thread/1150213174/Another+opening%2C+another+show..........%28many+pics%29+%26gt%3B%26gt%3B), and was instantly enamored. Readable, titanium, depth _and_ altimiter pressure sensors, thermometer, water sensor, great luminisity, lots and lots of cool nerdy features. Ebay did me in with a killer deal, and I'm wearing it now.

(Yeah Diego, lay off me, you have your own vices. Cut me some slack here.)

Negatives: No backlight, no countdown timer, uses a standard 2-year battery. 
Update: The manual says that the battery it ships with is a demo unit that'll last less than two years. Sigh. Now I have to find a service center when this one croaks. Oh well, it does have a low-power warning.
Update: The displays are metric-only, no English units. Personally, I prefer that, but some might not like.

Overall so far (~36 hours of wearing it): This is the watch for letting your [nerd flag](http://catandgirl.com/view.php?loc=94) fly. I'm still reading the manual, and it's pretty damn impressive. I've got it on a Seiko Z22 (urethane rubber) strap, and its comfortable and casual.

Me like.


**Update 9/10/06:** As David commented, there's no backlight. I can live with this because the analog portion has excellent luminosity, but those needing to use the digital portion should get one with a newer movement than the C900.
