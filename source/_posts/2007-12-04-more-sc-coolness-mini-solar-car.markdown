This was, by far, the coolest freebie at Supercomputing. Mini solar car! Just a solar panel, wheels and a tiny motor. Courtesy of [Taiwan's NCHC](http://www.nchc.org.tw/), for which I am quite grateful. It's not clear from the picture, but it's _tiny_ - 3.3 x 2.2 x 1.4 cm.

Today, I found that you can also get them [from ThinkGeek](http://www.thinkgeek.com/geektoys/science/9e8d/) - $19.99 each, ouch. It'd make a great kid toy if the kid in question has enough maturity to not break it right away. ;)

It's a lot of fun. The cell is small, so you need direct sunlight or a _really_ bright lamp. Mine stops outside when it hits shade.
