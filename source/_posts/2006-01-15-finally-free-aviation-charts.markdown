One of the lame things about flying is that _everything_ costs money, and usually too much. For example, you need to have maps to fly, by law. Usually a sectional or two, and perhaps a terminal chart. Eight bucks each as of Jan 06, and they last a few months. Then there's the every-56-days [AFDs](http://www.pilotstore.com/store/item.asp?ITEM_ID=484&DEPARTMENT_ID=39), your subscription for your aviation GPS, etc, etc.

It seems like Jeppesen has a monopoly on charts. You certainly can't get electronic charts from the FAA, anyway.

You **can** now get them from [SkyVector.com](http://skyvector.com/) The chart snippet above is from my local GA field. Skyvector does not claim to be legal or canonical, but its very useful, has lots of gmaps-style navigation, and is highly recommended by yours truly.
