If so, I highly recommend spending $4.99 on [Fieldrunners](http://www.subatomicstudios.com/), a '[Tower defense](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense)' type of game for the iPod touch and iPhone. Here's a screenshot from last night:

(Sorry for the rotated image, seems to be a wordpress problem)

There's a better and longer [review at Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2008/10/21/review-fieldrunners-for-iphone-appeals-to-tower-defense-nerds), but concisely I highly recommend it if you like tower defense-style games. Really well done indeed.
