We had a 2-day DSL outage, resolved by AT&T rolling a (super competent and very nice) 
tech out to the house. He replaced our TP-coax hardware, modem, backup battery and AC
adapter, only to find the outage was at a junction box where someone had unplugged us.

[Sattinger's Law](http://www.anvari.org/shortjoke/Observations/14_sattingers-law-it-works-better-if-you-plug-it-in.html). It's ironclad.

Anyway, newer modem is smaller and lower power, so a win on that front. Our IP changed, 
so it may be a while before the sites are visible again. I use dyn.com and their admin
site is fantastic. Recommended.
