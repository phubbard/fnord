![Nice ristretto](http://www.phfactor.net/wp-pics/190.espresso.jpg)](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/13/dining/13coff.html?_r=1&oref=slogin&pagewanted=allhttp://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/13/dining/13coff.html?_r=1&oref=slogin&pagewanted=all) There's a nice article in the times about good espresso making it from Seattle to New York. Annoying registration required, but [that's fixable.](http://www.bugmenot.com/view/www.nytimes.com) I was pleased to see references to Espresso Vivace Roasteria, my personal all-time favorite. Wish we had something that good locally.

Ahh, Vivace. It's of note that the owner, David Schomer, wrote a book called [Professional Espresso Techniques](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&tag=phfactor-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=%2FEspresso-Coffee-Professional-David-Schomer%2Fdp%2F0897166159%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1158112197%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks) that's **really** good. Though you risk ending up with the conviction that you really need to spend a _lot_ of money on espresso hardware.

Now I need a shot. Time to fire up the becoming-trusty [Aeropress](http://www.dansdata.com/aeropress.htm) and make me some flavor.
