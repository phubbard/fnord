Not only has a Republican made a very public about-face, it's local! San Diego mayor Jerry Sanders has declared support for gay rights. Mark Morford has [a great column on it](http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2007/09/26/notes092607.DTL&nl=fix), here's a quote:


> Could it really be happening? Was there really any way in hell a straight white male BushCo-era Republican would dare step up to a live microphone in front of a TV camera in a major American city and honestly admit that, well, he was wrong, and he is very sorry, and he has now officially reversed his position and now fully supports gay marriage and will actually sign a city council resolution acknowledging and advocating same?


[YouTube video here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnTwrnKb61Q%20), but [read the column first.](http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2007/09/26/notes092607.DTL&nl=fix)

Acceptance, it's a good thing.
