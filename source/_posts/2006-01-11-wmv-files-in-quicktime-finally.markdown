Microsoft's .WMV format has always been second-class on the Mac. The MS Media player is pretty crappy, to be frank. Recently, flip4mac released a ten dollar plugin for Quicktime that decodes WMV (non-copy-protected files) so you can use the Apple player. I was dithering, and then MS Done a Great Thing and released it for free!
