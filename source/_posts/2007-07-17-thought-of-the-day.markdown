Today's thought-provoking aphorism, courtesy of [my man JR.](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2007/06/17/this-man-is-one-of-my-heros/)



> 
14.
When a jet flies low overhead, every glass in
the cupboard sings. Feelings are like that:
choral, never single; mixed, never pure. The 
sentimentalist may want to deny the sadness
or boredom in his happiness, or the freedom
that lightens even the worst loss. The moralist
will resist his faint complicity. The sophisti-
cate, dreading to be found naive, will exclaim
upon the traces of vanity or lust in any motive,
as if they were the whole. Each is selling him-
self simplicity; each is weakened with his fear
of weakness.
