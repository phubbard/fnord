I've always been fascinated by the psychology of groups, and of course we're renters, so both posts are fascinating to me. I find myself 


* Hoping prices will fall so we can own again.

* Feeling guilty, 'cause a price drop will hurt a lot of people.


* Having apocalytpic thoughts about a housing crash followed by (or preceded by) a [Peak Oil](http://www.theoildrum.com/) crisis. Not a great time to bring a child into the world if true.



Piggington has very solid data on a bubble:

so I guess we'll just have to see what happens. The essays ([DadTalk](http://dadtalk.typepad.com/dadtalk/2007/06/a-graphic-look-.html) and [Irvine Housing Blog](http://www.irvinehousingblog.com/2007/06/25/houses-should-not-be-a-commodity/?ref=patrick.net)) are both excellent and worth a read.
