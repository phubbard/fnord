I decided to give [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) a try for comments. You can read more about it
[on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disqus). The short version is that it's a freemium
service, with the first paid tier starting at a staggering $300 per *month*. So yeah, free version
it is, until Octopress adds plain-Jane Akismet support.

### LSI update
I *thought* I had generated native code, but after a solid ten hours of cranking I killed it. So no 
latent semantic analysis for us, yet. Do, uh, leave me a comment if you have an idea!

In fact, please leave a comment and let me know how you like Disqus. If people hate it and want it gone, 
I would understand.
