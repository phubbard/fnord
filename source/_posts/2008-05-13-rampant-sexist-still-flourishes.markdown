Via [Science in the News](http://www.mediaresource.org/sitn/index.php) (good newsletter, by the way) a [depressing article in the Times Online](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article3908362.ece) entitled 'Sexist Culture Drives Women Out of Science.'

(The picture is Marie Curie, who knew all about science and sexism. Picture [from Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Curie).)

Here's a long quote:


> The majority choose their children and alternative careers instead of struggling with the hurdles of a macho “lab coat culture” with long hours, old boys’ networks and the risk of sexual harassment.

Sylvia Ann Hewlett, an economist at the Center for Work-Life Policy in New York and the lead author of the study, said the research had revealed a world with values seemingly stuck in the 1970s.

She said: “It has been a bit like a time warp. This predatory or condescending culture [towards women] was more common across the workplace 20 to 30 years ago but has somehow survived in an engineering, science and technology context.

“It is the hidden brain drain. We have this amazing, talented pool of women who have left the industry. It is highly destructive to our society and economy.”


I can testify to its existence, having seen the toll on friends and family alike. How's this for pathetic?


> The study, to be published in the Harvard Business Review on Thursday, found that while women made up 41% of newly qualified technical staff, more than half dropped out by the time they reached their late thirties.

Nearly two-thirds of all women surveyed said they had been victims of sexual harassment in the workplace. A similar number objected to the “lab coat culture”, in which researchers laboured over experiments, “tethered to the microscope”, for up to 12 hours a day.


More than half dropped out? Damn but we suck.
