"CoRD is a Mac OS X remote desktop client for Microsoft Windows servers using the rdp protocol. It is easy to use, fast, and free for anyone to use or modify."[http://cord.sourceforge.net/](http://cord.sourceforge.net/)

...and it works better than anything else, including the MS client. An essential Mac tool.
