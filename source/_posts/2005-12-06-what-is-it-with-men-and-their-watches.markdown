[...is the title of this Guardian article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,1654848,00.html). Not many conclusions, but worth a read. I agree with the author that our [relationship with our watches](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/?p=7) has gotten more complicated.

S/he also hits the 'watches as jewelry' point that I mentioned.
