Christian Cantrell, who runs [WatchReport](http://watchreport.com/), has started a new site called [TipBin.](http://tipbin.com) I write for him on WatchReport, so he asked me to try out the site and share it with my friends. Since both of you (a joke, I hope!) read this blog, please head on over there, write some tips, see what you think and let them know.

It reminds me of Matthew Baldwin's [Tricks of the Trade](http://tradetricks.org/), but hopefully with more content. Baldwin decided to write a book from the tips, and since then the content flow has slowed to almost nothing. Lame.

Hopefully TipBin can do better.
