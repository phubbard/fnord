This is just to say that the upgrade fixed our image upload problem. Whew.

These images are some of my favorites. It's from a test at former employer Sandia Labs:


> 
A full-scale F4 Phantom jet was accelerated to 210 m/s (496 mph) to impact a ballistic pendulum, comprised of a 3.6 m (12 ft) thick reinforced concrete block on air bearings. This test was conducted for the Kobori Research Complex, Tokyo, Japan. The purpose of the test was to measure the impulse of the aircraft impacting a rigid mass. 




Boom.
