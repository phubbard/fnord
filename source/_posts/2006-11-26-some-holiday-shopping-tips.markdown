Found via [Lifehacker](http://www.lifehacker.com/software/saving-money/find-coupons-for-online-stores-with-retailmenot-211067.php), this is a collaborative site for online coupon codes, called [RetailMeNot](http://www.retailmenot.com/).

The other one that perhaps might be useful is [Wize](http://wize.com/), a site that aggregates user reviews of products in a manner similar to Google's PageRank. Worth a try.
