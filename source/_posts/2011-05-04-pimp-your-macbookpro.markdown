It's a clever idea. It lets you take the seldom-used DVD drive out of your Mac laptop and replace it with a second hard drive (or SSD). Current max 2.5" is 1TB, so you could conceivably have 2TB of RAID0 _in your laptop_.

Or 1TB of RAID0 SSD.

Price is decent but not cheap, $80 for the adapter. Given how rarely I use the DVD drive, this seems like a nice upgrade.
