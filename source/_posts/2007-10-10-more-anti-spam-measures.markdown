Today I found a link from [Project Honeypot](http://www.projecthoneypot.org/) to the [http:BL plugin for WordPress](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/httpbl/) that blocks various forms of crap - comment spam being a big deal here, as I somehow managed to accumulate over 108 _thousand_ of the attempts on this no-name blog.

Yeesh. Thank god for [Akismet](http://akismet.com/).

So the plugin is running, please send me email if you see any problems from it. It'll be interesting to see what it does to my visit stats, I suspect many of the 'visitors' are spam bots anyway.
