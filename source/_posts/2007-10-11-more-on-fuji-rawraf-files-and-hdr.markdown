Still trying off and on [to do HDR](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2007/07/09/aperture-hdr-and-more-about-the-new-camera/) with the new Fuji (s6000fd) camera. No luck yet, alas. I still think that HDR + polarizer would make awesome macro photos...

I can convert from Fuji-format RAF to DNG, but none of the HDR apps reads DNG, sigh. I really need to buy Photoshop one of these days.
