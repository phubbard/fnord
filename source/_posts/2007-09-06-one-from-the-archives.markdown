Courtesy of [Ben C](http://www.phfactor.net/wp-pics/img_1443-wp.jpg), an old picture of me, in LA, during the [UCLA Four Seasons experiment](http://users.sdsc.edu/~hubbard/neesgrid/UCLA-EBD/):

Not a bad picture, actually. Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf near the UCLA campus, after a long day in the summer heat. (Timex, OEM'd by AOPA with a B-17 on the face. Analog-digital, served me well, Diego has it now. FYI.)
