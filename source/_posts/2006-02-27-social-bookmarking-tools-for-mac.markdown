Ever since the advent of [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/), people have been changing how and where they manage bookmarks. Local, del.icio.us, .mac, etc.

I encourage you to experiment. Try [Safarilicious](http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/14/safarilicious/) to upload bookmarks from Safari to del.icio.us, then [Delibar](http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/25/delibar-the-missing-link-of-social-bookmarking/) to make them convenient on the menubar.

Also added this to [the mac page.](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2005/06/13/macintosh-programs-notes-and-recommendations/)
