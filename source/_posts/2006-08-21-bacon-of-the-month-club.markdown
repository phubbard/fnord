[![Yum!](http://www.gratefulpalate.com/Merchant//images_products/thirteen_bacon.jpg)Really!](http://www.gratefulpalate.com/Templates/frmTemplateM.asp?SubFolderID=0089&SearchYN=N) I got this for Chris's birthday last year, and it's worked out pretty well. A bit pricy, but rather cool and some of the bacon is marvelous.

Probably not worth doing twice, but it did make for a pretty unusual gift.
