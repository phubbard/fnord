Via [VSL](http://www.veryshortlist.com/lists/pick.cfm?email_key=dfac80fd-3611-4cdf-bfaf-5e1b36d8217a&tp=1), an interesting collection of author-read poems by Billy Collins, set to animations. (Quicktime movies)

So far, I've watched a couple and been favorably impressed. Quite good, and a novel way to present poetry. 

VSL is a once-daily email, and tries hard to be concise and interesting. I'm still subscribed, so I find it a net win, check the archives and see if you agree.
