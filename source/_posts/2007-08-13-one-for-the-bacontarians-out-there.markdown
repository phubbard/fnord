Not sure where I found this one, but an awesome and long post on [making your own bacon!](http://www.bsbrewing.com/blog/?p=261) Here's a snapshot:

As [previously noted](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2006/08/21/bacon-of-the-month-club/) we're fans, and one should never forget the crazy [bacontarians](http://bacontarian.com/), who strive to get bacon accepted as a diet.

Really.

Anyway, [read the article](http://www.bsbrewing.com/blog/?p=261), its both informative and amusing.
