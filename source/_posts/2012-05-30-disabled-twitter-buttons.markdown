After reading [this post](http://informationarchitects.net/blog/sweep-the-sleaze/) I've disabled
the Twitter functionality in Octopress. Should help the site load faster and make the pages
a bit cleaner to read. I never ever use the Tweet button on a site myself, so why hang
that crap on my own pages?

Also debating removing the github sidebar; any opinions there?
