Other than my man [James Richardson](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2007/06/17/this-man-is-one-of-my-heros/), the publishing world isn't exactly awash with aphorisms these days. I kind of suspect that they're difficult to write, since there's no room for error, excess or clumsiness. Along those lines, [43 Folders sends me](http://www.43folders.com/2007/11/07/everything-i-needed-know-i-learned-1600s) to a 400-year-old book of 'em by a Spanish monk named Balthasar Gracian. Title is "The Art of Worldly Wisdom," and since copyright wasn't an issue it's [available online. Enjoy!](http://www.online-literature.com/gracian/art-worldly-wisdom/)

A quick sample from reading the first set:


> xviii **Application and Ability**.

There is no attaining eminence without both, and where they unite there is the greatest eminence. Mediocrity obtains more with application than superiority without it. Work is the price which is paid for reputation. What costs little is little worth. Even for the highest posts it is only in some cases application that is wanting, rarely the talent. To prefer moderate success in great things than eminence in a humble post has the excuse of a generous mind, but not so to be content with humble mediocrity when you could shine among the highest. Thus nature and art are both needed, and application sets on them the seal.
