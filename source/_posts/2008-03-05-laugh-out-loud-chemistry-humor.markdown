Via [Dan's Data blog](http://dansdata.blogsome.com/2008/03/05/ill-take-things-that-burn-asbestos-for-100/), a chemist blogs about [chemicals he refuses to work with](http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/things_i_wont_work_with/). And he's damned funny.


> That's because the higher the percentage of nitrogens in the formula, the more you have to worry. Thermodynamically, nitrogens bonded to each other are always regarded as guilty until proven innocent - there's always the fear that they're going to find a way to throw off their civilized clothes and revert to wild nitrogen gas. That's a hugely stable compound. If your structure goes that route, all that extra bonding energy it used to have ends up diverted into flying shrapnel and loud noises.

One carbon, one hydrogen, and nine nitrogens - look at the time! Gotta run!


Enjoy. It's funny.
