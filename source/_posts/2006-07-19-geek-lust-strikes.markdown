Diego and I had talked about building something like this, only our idea was to use components sourced from OSHA-spec, and make it an HID-profile device using a Microchip PIC. This one is an actual USB2 hub! And you can almost certainly hack the software to do something cool.

Sixty two bucks, or I'd have pre-ordered one already. Damnably cool.
