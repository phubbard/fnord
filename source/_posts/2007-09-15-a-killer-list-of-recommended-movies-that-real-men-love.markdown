[Jess](http://www.toasterwaffles.com/) sent me a link to [this page of movies that 'real men love.'](http://www.doubleviking.com/real-men-love-43archive.html)
And **boy** would I get along with the author:


* Dark City

* Real Men Aren't Quite Sure How to Feel About Hudson Hawk

* The Ninth Gate

* Grosse Pointe Blank

* The Fifth Element

* Buckeroo Banzai


... and many more. Some of which I haven't seen, and will now add to the netflix queue.

Actually, he had me at Buckeroo Banzai. Whatta guy.
