I was reading about [Google Gears](http://gears.google.com), and discovered that Firefox 3 on OSX is supported. It's a quick install, and once you do so check out [Google Reader](http://google.com/reader) - you'll find 'offline mode,' where Reader will slurp down data for use offline and re-sync fast when you're back to civilization.  
  
Another reason to love Reader! It makes a compelling case for Gears, too. Highly recommended.
