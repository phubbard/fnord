I was listening to [Elbow](http://www.last.fm/music/Elbow) this morning while working on a report, and was struck by this lyric fragment:


> Words to make me stay

You said "Leave me and the plants die."


It really struck me as a compressed vignette, a moment where two people are struggling to make a relationship work and one of them tries a bit of humor to lighten the mood. Elbow is good that way, succinct and intelligent lyrics everywhere.

(The song is Not a Job, from Cast of Thousands. Listen to it [here on last.fm)](http://www.last.fm/music/Elbow/_/Not+a+Job)

The next thought that I had was a bit random - while everyone likes to think that they have a sense of humor, those that have defective ones are the same people who are angered when you try to introduce humor into stressful situations. "This is no time for jokes!" and similar responses. On the contrary, stress is _exactly_ the time for humor.

Of course, to make this all quite humorous, I just got an email of familial bad news. So now I have to try and apply the medicine I've just prescribed. Ahh, life, never dull.
