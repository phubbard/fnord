  1. The Metropolitan Opera [now has pay-per-view high-def streaming operas](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20081017-coloratura-on-demand-met-opera-adds-hd-streaming.html). I ran [their previewer](http://www.metoperafamily.org/player_preview/metplayer.html) and was impressed at the quality, so maybe Chris and I will try this on the iMac. The staging and production values look spectacular, higher than the shows we saw in Chicago, so if you want to sample opera this is about as good as it gets. Now if Netflix'd just get their Mac software done...

	
  2. Lisa Kudrow is doing a w[eb TV show called Web Therapy](http://lstudio.lexus.com/#vid1204). Haven't watched it yet, but she's done some good stuff and it's free.
