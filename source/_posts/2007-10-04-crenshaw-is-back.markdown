One of my all-time favorite columnists is a guy named Jack Crenshaw. He's done a [column in Embedded Systems](http://www.embedded.com/columns/archive/?content_type=pt) for a while, but dropped out for some time.

Today, he's back! (Or maybe he's been back and I missed it. Could be.)

Click on the equation for his latest. He's very good at explaining complex problems and how they matter when coding. Here's his [bio paragraph from Embedded Systems](http://www.embedded.com/staff/jackc.htm):


> Jack W. Crenshaw wrote his first computer program in 1956 for an IBM 650 computer. Since then he's earned his PhD in physics from Auburn University and worked at NASA on the Moon missions. He's currently a senior systems engineer at General Dynamics. He is also the author of Math Toolkit for Real-Time Programming (2000), where you can learn more about his career and the techniques he describes in his columns. Crenshaw enjoys contact and can be reached via e-mail at jcrens@earthlink.net.


From a bit of searching, it seems like he also [writes a political column](http://www.renewamerica.us/columns/crenshaw), haven't read that yet.

The computer press is [pretty lame these days](http://www.hubbard-software.com/software_oxygen_blog/2006/06/10/the-end-of-an-era/), so having Jack back makes me happy.
