The game is [Texas Hold'em King 2](http://www.magmic.com/texasholdem2.php) from magmic, and it's free. Go to _mobile.blackberry.com_ from your handheld browser, and download it over the air.

Like V1, it plays well and is a fun way to kill time on busses, standing in line, etc. 

There seems to be no web-based download, so over-the-air install is the only way its free right now.
