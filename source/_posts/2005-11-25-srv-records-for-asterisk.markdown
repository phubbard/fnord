I just added SIP and IAX2 records for phfactor.net to UltraDNS, so in _theory_ you can SIP-dial pfh at phfactor.net and it'll work... 

Got the idea from [slacker](http://slacker.com/~nugget/asterisk2.php), and found the details on [the wonderful VoIP wiki.](http://www.voip-info.org/wiki-DNS+SRV)

Looks like we'll convert over to Broadvoice VoIP for all phone - been using their BYOB $6/month plan and a cheap Grandstream 102 with good results. Noticed that Wired Test top-rated them (Broadvoice, that is) and am now shopping for a good Wi-Fi VoIP phone, suggestions welcome!
