Anna now has the expected digestive oddities babies get. The other night, she was being persistently and loudly flatulent, and after the usual "that's Daddy's girl" comments, I said we should nickname her "Vladimir."

Not for the one we know, but the Russian president.

...pause...

Putin, that is. Heh.

Give yourself a second to get that one.

Second, equally bad: Anna _hates_ wet diapers. She'll cry immediately, no matter the quantity. I voted her a second nickname: "Princess and the Pee."

Such is humor around here now. ;)
