An article](http://www.watchreport.com/2008/04/the-seiko-sprin.html) about the Seiko Spacewalk that I wrote for WatchReport is linked on [Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/2008/04/05/seikos-spring-drive-spacewalk-watch-for-earthbound-and-spacelin/) and [Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/376482/seiko-spring-drive-spacewalk-watch-brings-out-your-inner-space-cowboy). I'm Internet-famous! (Well, if you notice the byline when you read it.)

Cool.
