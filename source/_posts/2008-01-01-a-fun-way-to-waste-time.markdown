![Fun flash game for C/C++ coders](http://www.phfactor.net/wp-pics/templeofthesun.jpg)

Imagine a sorta-remake of Prince of Persia (the first one), done in Flash, with occasional pop quizzes on C and C++ programming. The game seems fun, played it for a few minutes. It was a promo for a contest that's ended, but the game's still there.
