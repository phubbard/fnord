Reto has a nice page up on exactly how to change those split pins. Nice to have, especially with the clear pictures and diagram.

**Update 10/14/07:** I've gotten a few comments and questions about Fossil bracelets, which have arrows in both directions. I don't have one, and Reto's page doesn't cover them. The best I could find was [this page of discussion](http://www.howardforums.com/archive/topic/1065400-1.html) which says that the pins are removable in either direction, a feature they're calling Smartlink. [This page on Epinions](http://www.epinions.com/content_91518111364) confirms this, and the author likes the idea. So you should be able to just push it out either side.
