Gotta transfer DNS from [UltraDNS](http://ultradns.com) (now costing $50/month!) to [EveryDNS.net](http://www.EveryDNS.net). Not gonna be simple.

Wish me luck...

**Update**: Here's why I'm moving. My UltraDNS contract is for 10k queries/month, and we're getting 10 times that. It's not showing up on the page views, so I'd guess it to be spammers.

** Update 1/9/08 2:30PM**: Update in progress, we have to wait for Network Solutions to update the root, and also for everydns to update their databases. Expect DNS errors for a day or two, sorry.

PS Yes, I donated to EveryDNS. Karma is good.

**Update 1/10/08**: Done! It works! A-maze-ing.
