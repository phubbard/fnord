it is a guide to ethical travel in an increasingly global market. It lists over 300 places to visit in 60 countries.

The guide lists places to stay, ethical tour companies and organisations to contact to arrange the visit. Even if you arenâ€™t planning a trip soon, it is inspirational to read about what people across the world are doing to make travel meaningful.
