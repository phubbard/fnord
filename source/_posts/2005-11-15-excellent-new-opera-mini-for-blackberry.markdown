Opera has released Opera Mini for Blackberry, and it's a free download. If, like me, you have BB OS4 or later, you have to manually select the 'low memory version', but that's pretty easy.

Use the browser on your blackberry to open [http://mini.opera.com/](http://mini.opera.com/)

I'm trying it now, but get download errors on both versions - 406, Jar not acceptable. My guess is invalid jar signature.

Odd, 'cause it works for the folks at BBC. I sent them feedback, hopefully they can fix this.
