...seems to be the new cool thing to do. I stumbled upon an interesting piece of code called Asaph, and setup a microblog at [http://asaph.phfactor.net/](http://asaph.phfactor.net/) The idea is that microblogging is superfast and easy, a single Javascript bookmark does it all. I'll add the feed to the sidebar, and please take a look now and then and leave a comment here.Amazingly, the entire Asaph download is 50kB! Quite refreshing. Update 3/30: Link fixed, please try now.
