Right now, my home 'net has a [Linksys RV042 firewall/router](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2007/06/06/eeenteresting/):

backed by an 8-port SMC switch that [I quite like](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2005/06/13/gigabit-ethernet-what-you-need/):

I'm happy with both, and today found that Linksys has updated the RV042 to the [RV4000 (product link)](http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Product_C2&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1150490915278&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper&lid=1527822279B03), which updates the ports from 10/100 to gigabit:

 **With jumbo frames!** (Read [this page](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2005/06/13/gigabit-ethernet-what-you-need/) to see why you should care about 'em.)

Very nice. Solid router/VPN plus 4-port gigabit, one less device to deal with. Hmm. Right now I have more ports in use:



	
  1. VoIP hardware phone ([Grandstream BudgeTone 102](http://www.grandstream.com/bt101.html))

	
  2. SIP <-> analog bridge ([Sipura/Linksys 3102](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2007/01/07/sipura-3102-asterisk-and-such/))

	
  3. Debian server

	
  4. Printer

	
  5. Wireless AP

	
  6. Network camera

	
  7. Router uplink

	
  8. Open


Hmm. Not easy to drop four of those, so maybe I'll have to wait for the 8-port version. If you need 4 or fewer ports, the RVS4000 looks most excellent.
