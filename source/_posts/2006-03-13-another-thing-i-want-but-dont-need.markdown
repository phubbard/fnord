In the mid-eighties, I was in high school and utterly broke. I saved up and bought my second watch (Lorus, white face, analog/digital, stainless steel, finally lost overboard in Lake Pend Oreille) on layaway. Took me _weeks_. 

At the shop, the owner (acquaintance of mine) showed me a really cool Seiko analog/digital watch, what I now know was probably a [H556, H558](http://www.makedostudio.com/watches/seiko-divers/) or one of the others in that product line. These are called 'Arnie' due to appearing in 'Commando', amusingly. It was about 10x more money than the Lorus, but I sure was smitten.

The seikos still go for three hundred bucks, used, twenty years later. So I'm not going to go buy one. However, on the [SCWF](http://www.network54.com/Forum/78440/) today, there was a link to a Yema of very similar style:

Mmm, pretty nice, and the price is good. And I'm _still_ broke.
