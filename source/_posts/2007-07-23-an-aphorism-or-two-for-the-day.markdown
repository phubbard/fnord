A screwdriver is for screws. When you pry
open a paint can with it, you have committed
metaphor, which is the second use of things,

cal.




and one more as a bonus. I remember this one whenever I hear the old city-vs-country argument.

What's the difference between provincialism,
which unthinkingly takes its situation for ev-
eryone's, and cosmopolitanism, which is con-
fident it has the right to?




...all from [James Richardson's 'Aphorisms'](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2007/06/17/this-man-is-one-of-my-heros/).
