I was reading the Wikipedia [entry on Algeria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria) this morning (following up on [the excellent NYT article](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/09/science/09bomb.html?pagewanted=all) on nuclear proliferation; France used the Algerian desert as a test range) and discovered that Algiers has Tuaregs:

Which made me wonder if VW considered the name clash for their Touareg:

(Both pics are from Wikipedia and lead to their source pages.)

Odd name choice for an SUV, wouldn't you think?
