Behold, the Asus Eee subcompact laptop:

(Best place to learn about it quickly is probably [the Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus_Eee).)

Summary: Subcompact, up to 2G of memory, solid-state disk (2, 4, or 8G), optional VGA webcam, wireless, 10/100 ethernet, 800x480 screen, runs Xandros or XP.

Cost?  Between 250 and 400 (e.g. [here on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/4G-Galaxy-Mobile-Internet-Preloaded-Black/dp/B000YEMKGY/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1196384572&sr=8-2) for one configuration), and likely to drop soon since it _just_ hit the market. As [this essay points out](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2007/11/commoditizing_our_future.html), its about damn time that the computer market started to get cheap at the low end. (Good essay, by the way.)


> The Eee isn't _quite_ the disposable computing resource I've been wanting — they'll have to shave a zero off the price tag for that — but it's close enough for now. It does the basics I need, runs portable cross-platform applications and editing open file formats, and if I leave it on a train or sit on it or something my immediate reaction will be to swear, check my backups, and buy another one, rather than to whimper and go talk to my bank manager. Which is as it should be.


I don't have a compelling need for one of these, but I can think of several people who do - those who want a long-life subcompact, cost-constrained people who want a real machine and so forth. One of these would be perfect for field deployments where space, weight and cost are large constraints.

Cool.
