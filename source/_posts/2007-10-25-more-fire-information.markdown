From Scripps Institution of Oceanography:



> SCCOOS has put together a collection of real-time data to support firefighting efforts in the 2007 Southern California wildfires, including meteorological station data, wind models, and satellite imagery.

We've also linked to the hpwren camera image site from our page.

You can find this data at:

We appreciate your help in getting the word out to the community.




Ties together the previously-posted MODIS data plus weather and satellite visuals. Nice.
