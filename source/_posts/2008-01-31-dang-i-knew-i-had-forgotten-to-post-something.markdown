Ages ago, the Quake 3 engine was open-sourced. Lo, these many months later, a killer open-source game has emerged, with most excellent artwork, environmental audio, addictive gameplay and Linux/Mac/Windows binaries...

Ladies and gents, I give you "[Urban Terror](http://urbanterror.net/)":

From their description of the game:


> Urban Terror can best be described as a Hollywood tactical shooter; it is realism based to a certain extent (environments/weapons/player models), but also goes by the motto "fun over realism" (fast gameplay and lots of action). This combination of reality and action results in a very unique, enjoyable and addictive game.


I found this a week or two ago, and its spread like wildfire among co-workers and friends. Fun to play, excellent over the net, and IT'S TOTALLY FREE!

This is beyond sweet. I have to find a way to Paypal these fine people some cash. Damn but I'm having fun.

Performance notes: My macbook pro 2.33 can run playable at 1600x1200, roughly 60fps idling and 40-ish when busy; playable. A co-worker just bought a 23" iMac so that he could play high-res at home, and I'm jealous. Haven't tried the other platforms yet. My Core Duo Mini runs a dedicated server just fine, seems to use <50KB/sec bandwidth and most of one core with up to 12 players connected.
