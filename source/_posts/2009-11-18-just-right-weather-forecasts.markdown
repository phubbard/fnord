As a cyclist, I always check the forecast in the morning so I know what to wear and expect. I grant you, the weather in San Diego is mild to a fault, but still.

Anyway, I've tried many sites, and recently gave [Weather Underground](http://www.wunderground.com/cgi-bin/findweather/getForecast?query=92093&wuSelect=WEATHER&MR=1) a try. Their forecasts are as good as anyone else's for this area (the microclimates and shore-to-desert gradient make the task impossible, really), but their killer feature took me a while to start appreciating:

"Nearly the same as yesterday." I didn't realize it, but a simple, English-language precis of the change is _exactly_ what I want when I'm deciding short-vs-long-sleeves. Combined with the precip-or-not, it tells me what I want to know, and nothing else.

Bravo!
