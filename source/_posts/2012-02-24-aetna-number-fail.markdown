Yesterday I got an email from [Aetna](https://member.aetna.com/):

![aetna snap](http://fnord.phfactor.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/24/aetna.png)

It suggests I complete thier HRA (Health risk assessment). This is something I found useful
while at UCSD, so I click the link, sign in to my account, and promptly get this:

![fail](http://fnord.phfactor.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/24/sorry.png)

...which has to be one of the least useful dialog boxes I've ever seen. At a guess, the email 
was form-generated, and my current employer lacks the HRA feature. But WTF, Aetna? Shouldn't
you, you know, check first?

Yeesh.
