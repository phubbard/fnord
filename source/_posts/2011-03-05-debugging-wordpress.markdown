About 3 weeks ago, a Debian update borked WordPress. It still serves, but I can no longer upload or insert images. Clicking the upload button... does nothing. No errors are logged, in the browser or on the server side.

Damnation. Anyway, today I'm updating plugins & themes, trying to find the problem. I've switched Fnord over to a different theme for testing - what do you think?

[This Debian bugreport](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=546292) has some ideas, no luck yet.
