This is work, sorry, but _very_ good personal news as well - I got funded! SDSC is having funding hiccups, so this is job security for a couple years, and my first stint as co-PI. Which is also a semi-big-deal, as my lowly MSEE is not normally worthy of co-PI status. I have an official PI exception for this grant.



Ahh, the academic caste system. Guess I shoulda gotten the phd, eh?



Anyway, job secure for a while, or as much as anyone can expect these days. Whew!
