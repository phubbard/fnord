Mac OSX is very adept at PDF files; the OS can generate 'em, search 'em, etc, etc. And of course they're everywhere on the Net for any application that requires formatting greater than HTML/CSS.

One consequence of this is that my hard drive now has an enormous pile of PDF files. It's getting to the point where its a pain to locate the one(s) I need, even with [Spotlight](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/spotlight/) and [Quicksilver](http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/). This is similar to the situation prior to iPhoto, in a lot of ways, but Apple doesn't have a solution out for PDFs.

Enter a third-party program called [Yep.](http://www.yepsoftware.com/) Commercial, alas, but _really_ cool. Tagging, searching, previews, all sorts of cool features. Incremental search really does it for me.

It's 34 bucks, free trial download. I might have to buy this one.
