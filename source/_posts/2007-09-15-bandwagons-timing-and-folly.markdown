Briefly, this sums it up:


![iphone, on t-mobile](http://www.phfactor.net/wp-pics/iphone-tm-wpa.jpg)


 Yep, that's an [iPhone](http://www.apple.com/iphone/). Yep, it's running on T-mobile, even though they don't sell it. Yep, it's [activated, jailbroke and sim unlocked](http://iphone.fiveforty.net/wiki/index.php/Software_Unlock). Yep, I'm delighted.

And yep, that's Chris and Anna in the background!

I actually got it Thursday, failed to successfully hack it that night, and only got it working today after [Craig's post](http://www.robotmonkeypants.com/2007/09/14/unlocking-an-iphone/) started me down a different direction. Turns out that  the GUI hack tools is both borrowed work and broken. No harm done, I guess.

The [YouTube fix](http://www.ging.co.nz/youtube.php) didn't work, so I need to re-do that, (Update 10/5/07: [This one](http://www.hacktheiphone.com/74/iphone_youtube_mac_74.html) worked.) and also [this page of EDGE/GPRS login info](http://home2.btconnect.com/Taniwha/gprs.html) didn't work for me. I still have the data plan I bought for my Blackberry, so my APN is

We went to the zoo today, and **data worked!**. In fact, here's a scaled iphone camera picture of Chris:

Not bad, not great, nice to have a camera on my phone. Some quick impressions so far:



	
  1. The [Nike+iPod kit](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2007/08/29/nikeipodwordpressplugin/) **doesn't work with the iPhone**. This sucks. Here pretty soon I'll remove the plugin and sidebar, as I sold my Nano along with the Nike bits to pay for the iPhone.

	
  2. The recessed headphone jack means I'll need an adapter for other headphones. Annoying but minor.

	
  3. Wonderful hardware, amazing software, some minor annoyances here and there that I'll blog about as I go along.

	
  4. I have the 8G phone, which made sense to me, and now have bragging rights 'cause [Chuck only has 4GB](http://www.dr-chuck.com/csev-blog/000365.html). Hah!

	
  5. My ancient Jabra 200 bluetooth headset paired up and worked great. Wish the BT stack had more capabilities (iSync, anyone?) but works OK for headset anyway.

	
  6. The [AppTap installer](http://iphone.nullriver.com/beta/) is perfect; a GUI of apt-get for iPhone. Sweet!

	
  7. The IM clients from AppTap don't do AIM addresses from mac.com, so I had to create a new handle and now have no one on my friends list. Hmm.

	
  8. Live traffic data on google maps on the gorgeous screen is a huge app for us. Since we carpool along a congested route, this is great for selecting plan B when the inevitable occurs.

	
  9. Without the AT&T contract and 2-year commitment, the price is a lot more reasonable. (Though a [very good Basic Instructions](http://www.basicinstructions.net/2007/09/how-to-fight-peer-pressure.html) disagrees with me here!)

	
  10. Since Wordpress supports it, I'm going to setup a mail account so that I can take pictures and blog them on the fly. I'm late to that concept, but hey! Should be cool.


Sweet toy. One less thing to carry, and I am delighted with how thin it is, really no pocket bulge at all. Me like.
