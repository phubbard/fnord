Yep, decided that enough progress made warrented getting it out there, so here soon you should be able to find and download Meltdown 0.7.0 [from the Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=Meltdown&c=apps&price=1). The app isn't showing up yet, I'm assuming they periodically regenerate the various indices and pages.

Next up: SSL support (tricky for self-signed certificates if you actually want to verify them) and a commercial icon from the IconFactory's stock collection.

Enjoy!
