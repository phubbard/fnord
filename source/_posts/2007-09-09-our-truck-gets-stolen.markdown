<strike>Sometime Friday (Sep 7th) night, some lowlife stole our truck:</strike>


<strike>![Old picture](http://www.phfactor.net/wp-pics/pickup-wpa.jpg)</strike>


<strike> The picture is old, but it looks the same. So, if someone offers you an SEV6 Nissan, 4WD, California plates 7W40313 VIN 1N6HD16Y2LC346979, it's stolen. Case number 07309541W with the San Diego Police department. Please call them at (619) 531-2000 if you see it.</strike>

<strike>Sigh. Across the street, sometime around midnight. One neighbor says they saw someone well-dressed with a flashlight. Another heard diminishing beeps around 12:30AM.</strike>

<strike>It was a great truck. The picture is from when, right after buying it from a friend, we drove Chris to her new job in Illinois.</strike>

<strike>Insurance? Nope, we had reduced it to liability, which made sense cost-wise but now we're just out the money. If I had a guitar, I'd be ready to write a gen-u-ine country-western song, eh?</strike>
