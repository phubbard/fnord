[It's now possible.](http://bbhub.com/2006/01/14/service-unlock-your-cingular-blackberry-remotely/)

This would have saved me much grief, back when [I was trying to unlock my 7290.](http://www.phfactor.net/bb/blog.html)

Dunno if it works, but one of these days I want to get an 8700 for T-Mobile, and right now you can only get them for Cingular.
