Via [techyum](http://techyum.com), the [Brio flying boat](http://techyum.com/2007/09/brio_flying_boat_1.html):

The vehicle comes as a kit and runs on an ultralight Rotex Austrian 52-66 horsepower two-stroke engine that's sold separately. Its propeller functions as an airscrew, so on water the thing operates as an airboat, the sort of boat used in shallow-draft environments like swamps. When flying, the airscrew is a "pusher," the term for a propeller at the rear of the plane.




Man, this is as good as [the flying car](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2006/08/08/i-want-my-damned-flying-car/) that I also can't have.
