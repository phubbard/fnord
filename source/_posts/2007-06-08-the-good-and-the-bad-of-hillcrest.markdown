The good is in the foreground - they have a local program where artists paint the telephone and power utility boxes. It's really cool, fun to look at and seems to keep them graffiti-free. 

In the background, the gasoline prices as of 6/7/07.

Then again, I was walking home from my [UCSD shuttle](http://blink.ucsd.edu/Blink/External/Topics/Policy/0,1162,12941,00.html), so it's not personally a large expense.

The juxtaposition of the two literally stopped me in my tracks to dig for the camera on the way home.
