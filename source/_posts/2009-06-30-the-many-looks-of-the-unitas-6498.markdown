I got an i[ndignant comment](http://fnord.phfactor.net/2009/06/16/stowa-marine-original-limited-edition-ii/#comment-80497) on [my Stowa post](http://fnord.phfactor.net/2009/06/16/stowa-marine-original-limited-edition-ii/) from a Panerai fan:


> I don’t get the Panerai link. Sure, it is based on the 6498, but so heavily modified that is stands on its own. This Stowa is not modified at all, so it’s no comparison.

Panerai watches are technical pieces of art. Stowa’s are nice watches, but works of art? Hardly.


Since this particular comment got under my skin, here's a bit of a stolen- photograph essay to disagree. (Each picture is a link to the page where I found it.) To refresh, here's the version from Stowa - decorated, Geneva stripes, swans-neck regulator:

Next up, the Panerai PAM36:

[![pam36](http://fnord.phfactor.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/pam36.jpg)](http://blog.breitlingsource.com/2009/02/17/proliferation-of-the-swiss-unitas-64976498/)

Yep, dead stock. They even left the screw notches unblued and the less-expensive index regulator. All that's done is the CNC-engraved logo text on the plates and bridges. Otherwise a dead-stock 6497, and not even an upgraded one at that. Considering that this watch goes for a ton of money, I'm unimpressed. (Check[ this one](http://www.essential-watches.com/shopping-cart.aspx?ID=15060&BrandID=20) out - used PAM36, only thirty three thousand dollars!)

Now, it should be noted that Panerai [_used_ to use Rolex movements](http://panerai.watchprosite.com/?show=forumpost&fi=717&ti=463631&s=0), in particular the [Cortebert](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortébert_(watch_manufacturer)) as well as the Angelus 240. Interestingly, [David Worland](http://www.hodinkee.com/blog/2008/9/10/1940s-panerai-radiomir-by-rolex-for-italian-navy.html) notes that the Cortebert was a $3 movement! In some of their 6497/8 models, they've redesigned the bridges and plates to resemble the Cortebert movement. Here's a pic of the Cortebert next to the modified 6497:

(Rolex on the left)

If you aren't a hardcore watch geek, those look pretty similar, eh? And if nothing else, at least Panerai is trying here to look like they have their own movements. (Interestingly, the Rolex has a plain index regulator, and the 6498 has a swans-neck.)

For a better example of what you can do to transform the 6498, consider the Omega 2201, as seen in the Railmaster XL handwind:

[![omega-2201](http://fnord.phfactor.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/omega-2201.jpg)](http://home.watchprosite.com/?show=forumpostf&fi=17&pi=3222956&ti=529396&s=0)

Now that's nicely done. New plates and bridges, vertical stripes, much harder to tell that it's a 6498.

For an even more extreme transformation, Dirk Dornblueth replaces the plates and bridges with a traditional German three-quarter plate:

[![dornb](http://fnord.phfactor.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/dornb.jpg)](http://home.watchprosite.com/?show=forumpostf&fi=17&pi=3222956&ti=529396&s=0)

Yep, complete with swans-neck, **real** blued screws and chaton-set jewels. Gorgeous!

That concludes today's rant. I should note that that Panerai has since created some movements fully in-house - my point is that some of their watches are just overpriced (IMHO) base Unitas movements. Not all, just some. Knowledge is power, folks.
