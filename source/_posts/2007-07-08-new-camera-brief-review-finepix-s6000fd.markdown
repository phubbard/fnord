(Pictures swiped from Amazon; link goes there.)

We got this looking for a SLR-lite, with good optics, skin tones and image quality. A couple of relatives already have the camera and vouched for it enthusiastically. The [review on Imaging Resource](http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/S6000/S6000A.HTM) was good, and for 318$ it was a great deal.

You also need a chip, make sure and get [type H](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XD-Picture_Card) (Wikipedia) and **not** type M - M is 3-4x slower! We got [this 2GB chip](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M73ERC/002-8622545-7884847) which is enough for both pictures and video.

I also recommend a UV filter as a lens protector, and I personally wanted a polarizer for watch photography. I found a [combined set for $17](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MDZGJK/104-9267325-0147933) that I like; its a standard 58mm screw mount.

I also got a card reader for my laptop that fits into my [ExpressCard/34](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExpressCard/34) slot. I got [this one from Kensington:](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LSVAXC/002-8622545-7884847)

It's six megapixel, 10x optical zoom (manually driven, which I like), both automatic and manual. Has a nice face detection algorithm, does 640x480 video at 30fps, and has a good [CCD sensor.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge-coupled_device) (As opposed to the less-expensive [CMOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMOS_image_sensor).) The lens opens out to 28mm-equivalent, which is wonderful for indoors and such. The macro and super macro do very well, and with my [new macro lightbox](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2007/06/06/macro-shooting-on-the-cheap/) I'm getting good watch pics.

I'll skip the detailed feature list, see the Amazon or Imaging Resource links for those.

You can see albums from the camera [here](http://www.phfactor.net/pics/annas-birth/), [here](http://www.phfactor.net/pics/anna-2-to-4/) and [here.](http://www.phfactor.net/pics/misc-anna/)

Bottom line: I like it. Recommended.
