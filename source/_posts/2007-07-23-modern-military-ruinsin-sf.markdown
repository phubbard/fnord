Via the fascinating weblog of [Telstar Logistics](http://telstarlogistics.typepad.com/telstarlogistics/), a Flickr set on [modern military ruins in San Francisco](http://www.flickr.com/photos/telstar/sets/56935/):

In 1990, the San Francisco Bay Area was home to several large U.S. military facilities.

By 2000, they were all gone.

These are scenes from the Bay Area's recently-abandoned, Cold War-era bases: Hunter's Point Naval Shipyard (San Francisco), Treasure Island Naval Station (San Francisco), Alameda Naval Air Station (Alameda), the SF-88 Nike Missile Site (Marin Headlands), Hamilton Field Air Force Base (Novato), Mare Island Naval Shipyard (Vallejo), Naval Security Group Activity base (Skaggs Island), and portions of Moffett Field Federal Airfield (Mountain View).




Very cool indeed. If you like this sort of thing, be sure and check out [Subtopia](http://subtopia.blogspot.com/) as well.
