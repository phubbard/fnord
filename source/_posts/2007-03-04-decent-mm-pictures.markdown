As I said [on the SCWF](http://www.network54.com/Forum/78440/thread/1173035865/There+are+many+like+it%2C+but+this+one+is+mine), I was experimenting with a small tripod and a piece of paper as a light reflector. The first one came out better, shows the dial pretty close to how it normally looks. The reflective indices and hands are hard to photograph; I think this is decent.
