Thanks to Charles Bacon at Argonne for this one; he had to fly to Amsterdam on a half-days' notice to repair a cluster that had been dropped by UPS. He came back with some entertaining stories and a stash of black, diamond-shaped [salt licorice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_licorice) marked 'Salino.' It was unlike any I had had before, with an intense anise flavor and odd bite. Here's a picture I found on the web:

(As an aside, the bite comes from [Ammonium chloride](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_chloride).)

These are _really, **really**_ hard to find in the US. Lisa Childers, bless her soul, finally got 'er done. Head over to [Hollandsedrop.com and hit 'Special order Laura.'](http://www.ccnow.com/cgi-local/cart.cgi?lamarelbv_LQ086_continue-page) Quite expensive, almost $75 shipped, but it **is** 3 kilos of the good stuff.

Another, even more intense, is 'DZ' or double salt:

Definitely an acquired taste, also available from Hollandsedrop. For a nice hater review, [check out this page on Bad candy.](http://www.bad-candy.com/old/bc2/doublezout/doublezout.html)

Anyway, I've been out for months and put in an order today; this page is just so I can find the order info next time. ;)
