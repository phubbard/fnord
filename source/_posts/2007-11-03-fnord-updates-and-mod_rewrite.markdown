Sorry for the errors this morning, I was hacking [mod_rewrite](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_rewrite.html) ([alt doc here](http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/136)) to setup another blog on the same server, with a different hostname, but [still sharing the same PHP files so it'll get auto-updated via Debian](http://sharealike.org/index.php/2007/04/07/multiple-wordpress-blogs-on-a-debian-server/). It may go up and down a bit more, but permit me to introduce Annalog, Chris's new blog! It's marked as non-search engine, so you'll have to enter this manually into your browser:


http://annalog.phfactor.net/


Enjoy! 

Update 11/4: No content yet, still broken, premature announcement...will update.

**Update 11/10:** Working now, still don't have email notifications yet due to plugin issues. Work continues, content is up!
