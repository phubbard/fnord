I've been a member of [IEEE](http://www.ieee.org) and [ACM](http://www.acm.org/) since 1997, back when I was an undergrad. For a while 
I did some volunteer work for IEEE (for their [GOLD program](http://www.ieee.org/membership_services/membership/gold/index.html)) though I quit in
frustration after a short time. 

Anyway, yesterday I got an email from the IEEE reminding me that my email alias, phubbard@computer.org, was
going to expire unless I renewed my membership here soon. Which lead me to think a bit and ask a simple question:

> What am I getting from professional memberships and is it worth the cost?

After all, IEEE is about $200 per year and ACM is ~$100; are they worth it?

It used to be that professional societies provided human networking, training, insurance plans, and publications. 
These days, with LinkedIn, various websites and such, the only service I actually *use* is the email alias,
and it's not like that's of great value to me. 

A couple of bullet points on the resume, meh. "Member of IEEE and ACM" has never gotten a comment.

Let's not even *mention* the free magazines you get. They're worthless, full stop.

I suspect that a lot of societies, both fraternal and professional, are going to have to
reinvent their utility in the age of the Internet. The old value propositions no longer hold, and
they need to find new ways to be useful. For me, as a working developer, IEEE and ACM no longer
make the cut. Here's hoping I have reason to reconsider some day.
