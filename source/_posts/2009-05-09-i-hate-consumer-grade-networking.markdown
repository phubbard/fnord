I run [Smokeping](http://oss.oetiker.ch/smokeping/) as part of my suite of network monitoring tools and quite like it. Today it's telling me things I don't want to hear:

Odd how the delay and variance went though the roof there on the right, eh? If you look closely, the changes in the baseline delay before that were due to router changes on Speakeasy - we moved to AT&T in mid-March.

Let's zoom in:

Now here's my problem - if I call AT&T and explain what I'm seeing, it'll probably take hours just to get to a tech who _doesn't_ assume I'm an idiot. I'm fully expecting front line techs that believe that, if the net is up then the call is over.

Ahh, my kingdom for a geek-friendly ISP sometimes.

One does wonder - router change? More people on the subnet? Porn-addicted suburbanites?

**Update 5/26:**

We had a voice outage and rebooting router & wifi fixed it - actually, they reset the router, which was a pain. So now its fine and I don't know what the fix is. Yaaarrrrgggg.
