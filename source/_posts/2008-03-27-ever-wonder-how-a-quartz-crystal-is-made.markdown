Ever wondered how the tiny quartz crystals in your watch, computer, TV, remote control, microwave, car key, etc are made? New Zealand manufacturer Rakon has a a very nice presentation of the entire process here, in either [slideshow](http://www.rakon.com/process/index.html) or [single-page format](http://www.rakon.com/process/one-page.html). (The pictures are better in the slideshow)Very cool!  The first picture is of a multi-blade slurry saw, and the second is of the x-ray machine used to check crystal orientation... I knew that diffraction would show up here somewhere.
