A lot of people criticize Apple for its prices, but I have to say in response that taking the time to polish all the edges and simplify really helps.

It's a little thing, but for once I know to go get batteries, _before_ the mouse just stops working.

In [really high-end watches](http://ninanet.net/watches/others08/Mediums/mdufour.html), the inner bits are polished and finished by hand to astounding degrees, even the parts that will only ever be seen by a watchmaker doing the service. Perfection is it's own reward sometimes.
