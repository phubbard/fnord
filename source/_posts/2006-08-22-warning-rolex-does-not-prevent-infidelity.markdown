[This post](http://www.network54.com/Forum/169624/message/1156279806/&pp=x) has **got** to be a joke:





> 
I've been saving money fro something like three days, to buy a nice rolex explorer ref 114270. So finally after such a big effort I got it.....i was so happy that I went out to celebrate, I told my wife that I have a bussines diner...With so bad luck that my wife went to the same restaurant with Her boy friend.....I got so mad that I throu the idiot watch onto this guy's head..but by cheking the quality of it I injure this guy's head and the watch didn't suffer any scratch.......So please don't buy a Rolex explorer at least you want to be .....horned by your wife!!!!!




Saved for three days? For a 2500$ watch? Man, I want his salary.

Speeling errrs, total lack of capital letters, bad punctuation (and this from me!). I add it up as either a really bad day or a fairly good troll.
