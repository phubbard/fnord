Believe it or not, at least two friends have told me that the following sixteen dollar gizmo 'changed their lives'. Really. In so many words!

What is it? Well, it used to have the clever moniker of "Hold the Phone," and is sold by the droids helpful people at Radio Shack, where they now call it the ["AC Vent Wireless Phone Mount"](http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2103140&cp=2032052.2032075.2032076.2032086&parentPage=family). Kinda lost the sizzle there, dudes.

Here's their pic of it:

It used to cost twice as much, so the new price seems a fair trade for the staid name.

Oh yeah, the review: It works great. You can read the display and reach the controls, and its much safer since your eyes are closer to the road ahead. I've used it for 2nd gen 20G, third-gen 60G, 4th-gen 30G, Nano, and they all fit. The sides slide in and out on a spring release to accommodate different widths. The only thing that didn't fit was a case with an integral belt clip that pushed the ipod too far out from the back.

You slide the back bits into the air vent, and it has a lower tripod to stabilize it. Width is adjustable, so it should fit most air vents. Check and see where on the dash your vents are before you get one, though.

Recommended, quite a lot. I've been using this one for years and was thrilled to find that it'd fit the new Nanos.
