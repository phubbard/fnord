In my continuing (and pointless) obsession with mech watches, I've been looking for an analog with GMT.

[![Cheap chinese gmt](http://www.phfactor.net/pics/watches/alpha.jpg)](http://www.network54.com/Forum/78440/thread/1137011053/)

Purty, eh?

Looks like a Chinese copy of a Rolex, Miyota movement. Ebay, $25 plus $20 S&H; from Asia. Cheap, in the mail, and am I looking forward to it.

Clearly, this whole watch thing has gotten a bit out of hand.
