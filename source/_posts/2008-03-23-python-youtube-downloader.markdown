I've been debating diving into Python or Ruby for the fun of it, done a bit of reading and polled [some friends](http://www.dr-chuck.com/csev-blog/) (consensus is to go for Python). Today, I found another reason to go Python: [this extremely handy command-line program](http://www.arrakis.es/~rggi3/youtube-dl/). It downloads videos from YouTube onto your computer, voila! Quite handy. Now to see if I can use [Visual Hub](http://www.techspansion.com/visualhub/) or [iSquint](http://www.isquint.org/) and transcode for the iPhone...

**Update 3/24/08**: This script isn't my work, just something I found via Freshmeat.net. Not sure what else it can do yet.
