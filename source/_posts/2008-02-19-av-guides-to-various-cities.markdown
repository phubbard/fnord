The Economist magazine now has a bunch of free audio/video guides to different cities online at [http://audiovideo.economist.com/](http://audiovideo.economist.com/)

Downloadable, or as RSS feeds, or viewable on the web. Oriented towards business, but interesting for culture/climate and logistics too.
