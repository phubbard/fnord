Got a new mouse yesterday, the Logitech MX revolution. I'm using it today to code, email, and such, the usual stuff.

This mouse **rocks.** The scroll wheel has inertia, so you can scroll fast and easily (it spins freely when you want it to), and the one-button-search (aka 'google button') is _very_ useful. You just highlight a word and press the button, and a new tab opens with a google search. You can also use spotlight or other net-based engines if you prefer. Damned useful for obscure OpenSSL API calls and such.

The side wheel does really well for application switching, and the tracking is smooth and precise.

It comes with a very small USB transceiver, it'd be nice if it were Bluetooth. Oh well.

The on/off switch on the bottom is really nice, means that you can toss it in your bag and not arrive with a dead mouse. 

Highly recommended.
