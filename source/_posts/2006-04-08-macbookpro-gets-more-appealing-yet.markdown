[![PC emulator for MBP](http://www.phfactor.net/wp-pics/parallels.jpg)](http://www.parallels.com/en/products/workstation/mac/)

My [Powerbook](/mac_progs.html) is getting old, 3 years or so. I've upgraded the memory and replaced the battery a few times, but code gets bigger and capacity drives requirements and .... yeah, I really want a new laptop. 

More ammo arrived of late with the news of a beta of a PC emulator that claims to run code at 90 to 95% efficiency on the new Intel-based [mac laptop](http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/). I've used VMware and Virtual PC for years, but emulating an Intel chip on a 1.25GHz G4 is pretty painful, and I use it only when I have to. This will probably run _very_ well, especially given that these laptops have **two complete CPUs** on them. 

Sigh. Someday. If you've got one, try Parallels and let me know.

PS The MBP has a new card format, and [according to Om Malik](http://feeds.feedburner.com/OmMalik?m=553) there's an EVDO card due out soon. Wireless broadband almost anywhere. Are "they" _trying_ to torment me?
