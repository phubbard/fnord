My office is in the [Calit2 building](http://calit2.net/) on the [UCSD](http://ucsd.edu/) campus.  Leading up to the front doors is a tile walkway where, it appears, people could purchase their choice of etchings. As I've strode over it, I would now and then spot an interesting tile.

(Here's a re-post of the walkway and building)

Today I took the time to capture a few that amused or interested me. Enjoy!

Some are cryptic, codes or ciphers of some kind:

Update 10/3/07: A contributor decoded this, it's simply ASCII. Text is "John Tusson CS 2002".

Some are humorous:

Heh, I can sympathize with that.

Or philosophical:

See [this Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world) to explain some of the 'hello world' bit.

I suspect the text cipher to be a simple [substitution cipher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher) from the repeated 'Hma' block, but feel free to let me know what you find. ;) The hexadecimal one, well I dunno yet. See above, decoded.
