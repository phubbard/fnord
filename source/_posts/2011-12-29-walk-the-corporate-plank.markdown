I'm spending some time culling the photo collection over break, found this one from the train station in Kyoto:

That's maybe six stories up. Captain's walk? Walk the plank? Architect gone mad with cantilevers? I've always wondered.

The station itself has awe-inspiring design, indoor-outdoor with a soaring roof.
