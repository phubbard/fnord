[![Lunch walk](http://www.phfactor.net/wp-pics/lunch-stroll-today-wpa.jpg)](http://www.phfactor.net/wp-pics/lunch-stroll-fullsize.jpg)


Via the Nike website, a scaled picture of my lunch 'run'. This is the [Nike+iPod as posted](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2007/08/29/nikeipodwordpressplugin/), click for the fullsize screenshot. The dip in the middle is dining; the sensor actually paused itself  so I did actually eat for longer than it shows.

Damn, this is cool.
