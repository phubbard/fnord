... is often interesting. Via [this TZ post](http://forums.timezone.com/index.php?t=tree&goto=2546401&rid=0), the news that Texas Tech had won a Sandia competition with a micromachined MEMS... clock.

Here's a screengrab from the movie:

One more small picture from the Texas site:

High-res CAD (as JPG) and more info can be found at [the Sandia announcement.](http://www.sandia.gov/news-center/news-releases/2005/mat-chem/mems-winner.html) The [TexasTech PR](http://www.depts.ttu.edu/coe/PressReleases/mems.php) is much more detailed, though.

The brief [student writeup (MS Word DOC file)](http://www.sandia.gov/mstc/documents/TTU_submission.doc) is also interesting.

Looks like the module would cost you 10k. Cheap by TZ standards!

Movie (not to be missed!) and more at [the department page.](http://www.depts.ttu.edu/ntc/ResearchAndPublications/MEMS.php)

Check out the movie to see it run - supercool. As a computer and watch geek, who also used to work for Sandia, this is all pretty darn neat. Not to mention the lovely juxtaposition of super-old-gear-clock with hypermodern fabrication.
