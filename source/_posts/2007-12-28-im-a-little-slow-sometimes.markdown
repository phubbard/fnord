In cleaning up today, I was playing one of my (several) unplayed [CMJ](http://www.cmj.com/newmm/) CDs, and found myself entranced by Regina Spektor's 'Fidelity.' You can hear it for free by watching the video on YouTube:


[![Snapshot from the video](http://www.phfactor.net/wp-pics/regina-spektor.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGTDRztaCCw)


I am, of course, at least a year behind in discovering this lovely track, but there you are. Learn more on [her wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regina_Spektor) and [the wikipedia page for the single.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidelity_%28song%29) Me like!

Update 3/3/08: [This page has all of her videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/ReginaSpektor) on YouTube FYI.
