All of a sudden (perhaps since the 10.6.5 update, not sure) my (legit, thanks) copy of Adobe creative suite 3 is almost unusably glitchy. I get this every time I run PhotoShop:

There are no updates from Adobe, and Google isn't finding others complaining yet. Odd. Yes or No to the dialog has the same result, i.e. it returns on app restart.

When I do my usual workflow of browsing for images, I get a similar dialog from Device Central:

Same thing here, no matter the selection it returns every time.

Neither of those is the _real_ problem. If you select a tool in Camera Raw, e.g. 'Crop', it will rapidly switch from that tool to the next tool on the right. In other words, ever pixel of mouse movement switches from 'Crop' to 'Rotate.'

It's fucking unusable. Dunno if this is Apple or Adobe, but **please fix this now**; PhotoShop is currently unusable.
