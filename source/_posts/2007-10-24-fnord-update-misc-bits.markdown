  1. The 2.3 WordPress update is reputed to fix [the breakin I had earlier](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2007/08/25/fnord-updates-downtime-themes/) - nice. Thanks, Debian!

	
  2. Postie (blog by email, e.g. iPhone) is borked, not sure why yet. No one seems to have a fix for this error:


> Fatal error: Cannot redeclare postemail() (previously declared in /usr/share/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/postie/postie-functions.php:9) in




	
  3. Email seems broken; I'm not getting notified when a comment is held.

	
  4. I disabled [http:bl](http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2007/10/10/more-anti-spam-measures/), might be part of the problem.
