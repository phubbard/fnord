The problem: organizing a group meeting/meal/activity. Figure out who has time when, who can attend, pick a time, etc.

Evite works, but is relentlessly commercial and spammy.

Via [Life hacker](http://lifehacker.com/software/planning/plan-a-get-together-with-renkoo-225063.php), [Renkoo](http://renkoo.com/) and [Diarised.](http://diarised.com/)

Haven't used either yet, but keep meaning to. Nice use of web, methinks.

Update: 2/25/07: The COO (!) of [Planyp.us](http://planyp.us/plans) suggests his/her site as well - see comments.
