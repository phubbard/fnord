Really, it's a harder question than you think at first. We're all kinda used to the visual language of television forecasters - simple maps, glyphs, a few numbers and a narrative to tie it together. Here's [today's Weather Undergound](http://www.wunderground.com/cgi-bin/findweather/getForecast?query=92093&wuSelect=WEATHER):

The map + radar view is also helpful, particularly if you're trying to see moving clouds or patterns:

But really, what I'm trying to glean is


* How should I dress?

* What's the trend? Is it getting colder or warmer?

* Umbrella/raincoat?



For those, [WeatherSpark](http://weatherspark.com/#!graphs;q=La+Jolla,+CA,+USA) is my new bestest friend. Check this out:

Map on the left (which you can close). Graphs on the right, with choice of data sources on the upper right (NOAA, met.no, WWO). And lovely, lovely graphs, shaded to show historic ranges, cloud cover, precipitation, where you are in the day and much, much more.

Maybe you have to have spent time interpreting graphs, but I have come to adore this presentation. It really works for me. From a graph I get a better grasp of the prediction and what the day will be like. 

Highly recommended.
